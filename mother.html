                <!--<div class="bodytxt1">-->
                    <p class="bodytxtblue1">The Good Wife is a sub-archetype of 
                        the Mother which embodies what classical patriarchal 
                        societies believe to be the ideal female spouse and mother. 
                        This usually means being servile to your husband, 
                        domestic, a home-maker and most importantly a 
                        child-rearer. This archetype is a reflection of 
                        what a woman’s expected roles in society were 
                        (and sometimes still is) and set the precedent of 
                        what it meant to be the ideal woman past childhood - 
                        a ‘good’ wife and a ‘good’ mother. Of course there 
                        are some nuances to this description - in Ancient 
                        Greece, deities that fit this archetype were also 
                        ruthless, however they were ruthless for concern of 
                        their child - Demeter is an example of this:</p>

                        <p class="bodytxtpink1">More contemporary figures of The Good Wife 
                            can be seen in American sitcom comedies that became popularised 
                            in the USA post WW2. Shows like  Leave It To Beaver and Father 
                            Knows Best were centred around nuclear, all-white American 
                            families - a father with a white collar job,  two or three kids 
                            and a doting housewife.1 These sitcoms were a response to post-WW2 
                            American societal shifts, with men coming back from the war and 
                            women displaced from the workforce and expected to become a wife 
                            and a mother, these change in societal shifts exacerbated in a new 
                            booming economy and the rise of suburbia.2 
                            However, some of these shows were also beginning to challenge these 
                            expectations. I Love Lucy’s premise is about a wife, Lucy, that 
                            wants to work and the joke of the show is that she is ‘bad’ at 
                            being a typical housewife (because she doesn’t want to be one), 
                            which frustrates her clueless husband.3</p>
               
                    <p class="bodytxtblue2">In Greek mythology, this archetype is 
                        best reflected by the Goddess Demeter, who resides 
                        over the Harvest, Agriculture and Fertility. 
                        Although spouseless in much of the literature,
                        her most well-known tale is centred around the 
                        love she has for her daughter, Persephone. After 
                        Persephone is kidnapped by Hades so that he 
                        could forcefully make her his wife, Demeter 
                        brought upon a deadly drought in order to convince 
                        the other Gods and Zeus that Persephone should be 
                        released:</p>

                    <p class="bodytxtblue3"> “Then that fair Nymphe Alpheias [Arethousa] . . . 
                        rose from her pool and brushed back from he brow her dripping hair, 
                        and said : ‘O thou, divine Mother, who through the world hast sought 
                        thy child, mother of crops and harvest, cease at last thy boundless 
                        toil and end they savage rage against the land that has kept faith with thee. 
                        The land is innocent; against its will it opened for that rape. 
                        While beneath the earth I glided in my Stygian stream, 
                        I saw, myself with my own eyes, your Proserpina. 
                        Her looks were sad, and fear still in her eyes; and yet a queen, 
                        and yet of that dark land Empress, and yet with power and majesty 
                        the consort of the Tyrannus Infernus (Sovereign Lord of Hell) [Haides].’ 33</p>
