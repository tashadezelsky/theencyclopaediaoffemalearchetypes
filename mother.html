                        <p>The Good Wife is a sub-archetype of 
                        the Mother which embodies what classical patriarchal 
                        societies believe to be the ideal female spouse and mother. 
                        This usually means being servile to your husband, 
                        domestic, a home-maker and most importantly a 
                        child-rearer.1 This archetype is a reflection of 
                        what a woman’s expected roles in society were 
                        (and sometimes still is) and set the precedent of 
                        what it meant to be the ideal woman past childhood - 
                        a ‘good’ wife and a ‘good’ mother. Of course there 
                        are some nuances to this description - in Ancient 
                        Greece, deities that fit this archetype were also 
                        ruthless, however they were ruthless for concern of 
                        their child - Demeter is an example of this:</p>

                            <p>More contemporary figures of The Good Wife 
                            can be seen in American sitcom comedies that became popularised 
                            in the USA post WW2. Shows like  Leave It To Beaver and Father 
                            Knows Best were centred around nuclear, all-white American 
                            families - a father with a white collar job,  two or three kids 
                            and a doting housewife.1 These sitcoms were a response to post-WW2 
                            American societal shifts, with men coming back from the war and 
                            women displaced from the workforce and expected to become a wife 
                            and a mother, these change in societal shifts exacerbated in a new 
                            booming economy and the rise of suburbia.2 
                            However, some of these shows were also beginning to challenge these 
                            expectations. I Love Lucy’s premise is about a wife, Lucy, that 
                            wants to work and the joke of the show is that she is ‘bad’ at 
                            being a typical housewife (because she doesn’t want to be one), 
                            which frustrates her clueless husband.3</p>

                        In Greek mythology, this archetype is 
                        best reflected by the Goddess Demeter, who resides 
                        over the Harvest, Agriculture and Fertility. 
                        Although spouseless in much of the literature,
                        her most well-known tale is centred around the 
                        love she has for her daughter, Persephone. After 
                        Persephone is kidnapped by Hades so that he 
                        could forcefully make her his wife, Demeter 
                        brought upon a deadly drought in order to convince 
                        the other Gods and Zeus that Persephone should be 
                        released:

                        and Persephone is said to spend half a year in the underworld with her husband, 
                        and the other half outside of it with her mother.5  
                        Demeter is identified, therefore, by her existence as a mother - 
                        unlike other Goddesses in the pantheon, she is exulted not for her wisdom, battle acumen or matchmaking, but for her dedication to motherhood.6
                        In other cultures, The Good Wife can be seen in Hinduism’s Sita, 
                        Vishnu’s consort and the Goddess of Beauty and Devotion. 
                        Devotion to her husband is quite literally the power wherein she resides in 
                        Hindu mythology, showcasing how, similar to Demeter, 
                        how important the role of a devoted wife is in the society where she is 
                        worshipped  and why such a sub-archetype therefore exists.</p>

                            Throughout the 21st century, the sitcom wives and the ‘ideal’ wife 
                            in media has become further developed and  nuanced, in accordance to 
                            the increase in conversations about women’s and civil rights, 
                            especially in the west.4 
                           <!----> <br><br> Dark comedy series released in 2021 named Kevin Can F**k Himself 
                            specifically flips the idea of the sitcom wife on its head. 
                            Protagonist Allison Roberts (played by Annie Murphy)  
                            is unhappily married to her husband, Kevin, who is an “insensitive. 
                            unambitious manchild.”5 She is so frusturated with Kevin she wants 
                            to kill him (however she ends up faking her own death and starting anew, 
                            leaving her husband to fend for himself instead in the finale)6 
                            The show utilises unique camerawork and filming methods to highlight her 
                            dissatisfaction - when Allison is with Kevin, the series utilises multi-cam 
                            and saturated colours, along with easy jokes and canned laughter - 
                            all characteristics of a typical sitcom, whereas when she is ‘off-camera’ 
                            (ie out of the sitcom scenario and on her own), the colours become gritty, 
                            darker and harsher to reflect the reality she lives in, as well as her misery. 
                            7 Through its characters and camera work, the series explores the grim 
                            realities of the life of a typical sitcom wife, illuminating that behind the 
                            lighthearted jokes this archetype was built upon decades of misogyny in the
                            media, and in the finale avenging the sitcom wife as she is set free from her
                            marital shackles.</br></br>
