                                    <b class="n">The Good Wife</b> is a sub-archetype of 
                                the Mother which embodies what classical patriarchal 
                                societies believe to be the ideal female spouse and mother. 
                                This usually means being servile to your husband, 
                                domestic, a home-maker and most importantly a 
                                child-rearer.<sup>1</sup> This archetype is a reflection of 
                                what a woman’s expected roles in society were 
                                (and sometimes still is) and set the precedent of 
                                what it meant to be the ideal woman past childhood - 
                                a ‘good’ wife and a ‘good’ mother. Of course there 
                                are some nuances to this description - in Ancient 
                                Greece, deities that fit this archetype were also 
                                ruthless, however they were ruthless for concern of 
                                their child - <b class="n">Demeter</b> is an example of this:</p>

                                    can be seen in American sitcom comedies that became popularised 
                                    in the USA post WW2. Shows like <b class="n">Leave It To Beaver</b> and 
                                    <b class="n">Father Knows Best</b> were centred around nuclear, all-white American 
                                    families - a father with a white collar job, two or three kids 
                                    and a doting housewife.<sup>1</sup> These sitcoms were a response to post-WW2 
                                    American societal shifts, with men coming back from the war and 
                                    women displaced from the workforce and expected to become a wife 
                                    and a mother, these change in societal shifts exacerbated in a new 
                                    booming economy and the rise of suburbia.<sup>2</sup>
                                    However, some of these shows were also beginning to challenge these 
                                    expectations. <b class="n">I Love Lucy’s</b> premise is about a wife, <b class="n">Lucy</b> that 
                                    wants to work and the joke of the show is that she is ‘bad’ at 
                                    being a typical housewife (because she doesn’t want to be one), 
                                    which frustrates her clueless husband.<sup>3</sup></p>

                                In Greek mythology, this archetype is 
                                best reflected by the Goddess <b class="n">Demeter,</b> who resides 
                                over the Harvest, Agriculture and Fertility. 
                                Although spouseless in much of the literature,
                                her most well-known tale is centred around the 
                                love she has for her daughter, <b class="n">Persephone.</b> After 
                                <b class="n">Persephone</b> is kidnapped by Hades so that he

                                brought upon a deadly drought in order to convince 
                                the other Gods and Zeus that <b class="n">Persephone</b> should be

                                and said : ‘O thou, divine Mother, who through the world hast sought

                                unlike other Goddesses in the pantheon, she is exulted not for her wisdom, battle acumen or matchmaking, but for her dedication to motherhood.

                                    Throughout the 21st century, the sitcom wives and the ‘ideal’ wife

                                    the increase in conversations about women’s and civil rights, 
                                    especially in the west.<sup>4</sup>

                                    specifically flips the idea of the sitcom wife on its head. 
                                    Protagonist <b class="n">Allison Roberts</b> (played by Annie Murphy)  
                                    is unhappily married to her husband, Kevin, who is an “insensitive. 
                                    unambitious manchild.”<sup>5</sup> She is so frusturated with Kevin she wants 
                                    to kill him (however she ends up faking her own death and starting anew, 
                                    leaving her husband to fend for himself instead in the finale)<sup>6</sup> 
                                    The show utilises unique camerawork and filming methods to highlight her

                                    and saturated colours, along with easy jokes and canned laughter - 
                                    all characteristics of a typical sitcom, whereas when she is ‘off-camera’ 
                                    (ie out of the sitcom scenario and on her own), the colours become gritty, 
                                    darker and harsher to reflect the reality she lives in, as well as her misery.<sup>7</sup>
                                    Through its characters and camera work, the series explores the grim 
                                    realities of the life of a typical sitcom wife, illuminating that behind the 
                                    lighthearted jokes this archetype was built upon decades of misogyny in the
                                    media, and in the finale avenging the sitcom wife as she is set free from her
                                    marital shackles.</br></br>

                                of the Mother whose characteristics do not typically align with patriarchal 
                                standards of what the ideal wife and mother should be like. <b class="n">The Imperfect Mother</b> 
                                is therefore perhaps not the most nurturing mother in the world, or the kindest. 
                                She is typically rough around the edges and unsympathetic, and in the following 
                                historical examples almost always powerful, respected and authoritarian. 
                                Historical examples are also less subtle and much more cruel than their contemporary 
                                counterparts, however they provide a foundation of the ideas this sub-archetype 
                                originated from.

                                <p> <b class="n">The Imperfect Mother</b> archetype is definitely a figure of interest in a 
                                    lot of literature and media, especially in the 20th and 21st century. 
                                    Instead of being harsh, cruel and malevolent like her historical counterparts, 
                                    the modern <b class="n">Imperfect Mother</b> is a figure that is grappling with her own inner demons, 
                                    struggling with the pressures of parenting and the expectations of perfection 
                                    when it comes to motherhood. These traits all however tie into the fact that this mother 
                                    tends to hurt their children because of their own issues, whether intentionally or not.<sup>1</sup> 
                                    Movies such as 1968’s <b class="n">Rosemary’s Baby<sup>2</sup></b> or 1962’s <b class="n">Mamma Roma<sup>3</sup></b> explores these themes, 
                                    portraying troubled women who have complicated relationships with their identities as mothers -  
                                    their personal struggles, aspects of their personalities and societal pressures leading 
                                    them to unintentionally hurt their children, although the love they have for them is undeniable. 
                                    These movies show that even if someone is a mother, it doesn’t mean they are perfect or angelic 
                                    by any means, and all mothers will make mistakes even out of love for their child.</p>

                                The first and only female empress of China, <b class="n">Wu Zeitan,</b> who ruled between 624-705 A.D, 
                                was rumoured to have suffocated her daughter to death to achieve her rise to power. 
                                As a concubine, her sons fathered by the Emperor did not have any claims to the throne.

                                    Generational trauma as a theme has also been prevalent surrounding the exploration and

                                    how generational trauma affects parenting and motherhood, and how certain aspects of trauma 
                                    will be passed down and can negatively affect your child.<sup>4</sup>  Two movies released in 2021 and 2017

                                    strained relationships with their daughters as both sides struggle to communicate to one another. 
                                    The love for their children is clear, however the mothers struggle to express it due to conflicting

                                    experiment to further your own ambitions is a deeply, horrifically abusive thing to do, and Jobu’s 
                                    spreading of that pain outward from herself is an evocative depiction of how cycles of abuse 
                                    perpetuate themselves. She isn’t abusive to her Joy, but she isn’t a good mom by any means. 
                                    She’s way too critical, and she’s deeply uncomfortable with Joy’s long-term relationship with 
                                    another woman. Yet these are offenses, the film argues, that could be overcome with a sincere 
                                    apology and attempt to do better. Maybe. As such, Jobu meeting protagonist Evelyn will hopefully 
                                    allow both to find some way to move forward together and forget the past. Maybe.”<sup>6</sup></span>

                                    different ambitions and motivations, however what links them is their position of power 
                                    over their family or community. Examples of religious deities that fit this sub-archetype

                                        of authority and power, and although less obviously blood-thirsty, some - if not most - 
                                        have kept an element of the same ruthlessness as their historical / folkloric counterparts. 
                                        In literature, Shakespeare’s <b class="n">Queen Titania</b> (in <b class="n">A Midsummer’s Nightdream</b>) although not a
                                        biological mother, commands the faerie realm and has the respect of the other characters 
                                        of the play (even when she is tricked by her husband).<sup>1</sup> From his writing, we can tell that 
                                        she is someone who is feared - even by her husband, Oberon - and acts as the sovereign

                                        and authority can be seen by the sovereign and Celtic goddess of war, <b class="n">Macha.</b> Although married,

                                        to compete to the death in a race forced upon her by her husband while she is pregnant. 
                                        The curse would take away their strength when they need it the most, and they would feel the 
                                        pains of childbirth in its place.<sup>7</sup> By displaying her ruthlessness and power, her place in 
                                        Celtic mythology is a sovereign and matriarchal one above that of any male deity, making her 
                                        the key figure in the folklore.

                                        <b class="n">Lady Eboshi</b> from Studio Ghibili’s 1997’s Princess Mononoke is another example of a matriarchal 
                                        figure in modern media. <b class="n">Eboshi</b> acts as the antagonist Ashitaka, the protagonist, waging war on 
                                        the nature gods for her own purposes, ruthlessly harming them in the process (she shoots the 
                                        head of the god of the forest, causing chaos). However, despite her flaws, she is still the 
                                        main figure of authority and leadership of the her village, and is loved and respected by her 
                                        community.<sup>5</sup>  We can see that her immoral actions have been for the sake of her people and they 
                                        love and respect her in turn (they never go against her even when the ‘morally correct’ protagonist 
                                        does.) <b class="n">Eboshi</b> is therefore a character that embodies the ruthlessness of her historical ancestors, 
                                        while also being multi-faceted and relatable like her modern counterparts.

                                    created in. During the 18th / 19th century, it was extremely common for women to die in childbirth,
                                    and the mortality rate was already very low, and  many children were left solely in the care of 
                                    their father - unless he remarried. This sub-archetype acts as a cautionary tale for both the 
                                    father and the step-mother - to do right by the children, or else something horrible may happen 
                                    to you.<sup>4</sup> Interestingly, studies have shown that “stepparents do harm children at higher rates 
                                    per capita than genetic parents.” however all instances of violence are committed by the 
                                    stepfather, not the stepmother.<sup>5</sup> The stories therefore do not reflect reality and it is important 
                                    to ask the questions of why have the stepmothers been villanised, and why is the abuse in these 
                                    stories almost always targeted toward the stepdaughter, and never the sons.

                                    The fear of <b class="n">The Stepmother</b> can also be seen in folklore outside of the west. 
                                    <b class="n">Janghwa Hongryeon Jeon</b> (or <b class="n">A Tale of Two Sisters</b>) is a folktale from South Korea that depicts 
                                    a cruel stepmother’s abuse that results in the death of two daughters - <b class="n">Janghwa</b> and <b class="n">Hongryeon</b> 
                                    - however the stepmother and her sons are sentenced to death for their misdeed against the 
                                    girls and are put to death<sup>6</sup> (significantly, the father although also complicit in the abuse,  
                                    is judged as innocent as he wasn’t aware of his wife’s crimes).

                                        As with most sub-archetypes however, there has been a backlash seen in modern media against the 
                                        evil stepmother trope. The 1998 movie <b class="n">Stepmom,</b> starring Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon sees 
                                        the stepmother, <b class="n">Isabel,</b> attempting to do her best to connect with her new husband’s family
                                        who are fiercely loyal to their mother, <b class="n">Jackie.<sup>5</sup> The Stepmother</b> is the protagonist and the 
                                        sympathetic figure in the narrative, while the original mother is the antagonist, however the 
                                        film gives nuanced reasons as to why the two women act this way, and ends not with one woman 
                                        ‘winning’ over the other, but them coming to a mutual understanding and even becoming friends 
                                        to make the transition easier for the rest of the family, as well as themselves. Although 
                                        dramatised, this dynamic may be a far more accurate representation of modern families today, 
                                        and how step-families cope with changing family dynamics.

                                        <b class="n">Brenda MacGuff</b> from 2007’s <b class="n">Juno</b> is another character that turns the evil stepmother trope on 
                                        its head, as she is and incredibly supportive stepmother to her step-daughter and protagonist, 
                                        <b class="n">Juno.<sup>6</sup></b> Like <b class="n">Isabel,</b> she reflects a more nuaunced reality of stepmothers and modern family 
                                        dynamics, and challenges the evil stepmother trope.
