                                        The Bookworm as a sub-archetype is defined by a woman/girl who stands out because 
                                        of her brilliant mind, wit and intelligence. This trait warranted significance, 
                                        particularly in antiquity, as women were generally not encouraged to be overtly 
                                        knowledgeable or educated - the main priority was to be married off and bearing 
                                        children by her early 20s,<sup>2</sup> with the praise for intelligence reserved solely for 
                                        men. Therefore it can be seen by female divinities such as the Greek Goddess Athena, 
                                        who was worshipped for her unparalleled wisdom and skills at war strategy,<sup>3</sup> or the 
                                        Mesopotamian Goddess of writing and accounting, Nisaba,<sup>4</sup> that intelligence in womean 
                                        were significant enough to warrant attention, especially ones who presided over a 
                                        typically male dominated field because of its visible and un-oppressed rarity in 
                                        every-day life.

                                        The Bookworm has become an extremely popular and well-known character archetype in 
                                        modern and contemporary media as conversations around female empowerment and equality 
                                        increased.<sup>1</sup> Characters in 19th-20th century western literature such as Pride and 
                                        Prejudice’s Elizabeth Bennet<sup>2</sup> were beloved as they showcased spunky, well-educated 
                                        female characters that deviated from the typical damsel in distress stereotype that 
                                        so many women were restricted too during this time period.<sup>3</sup> They were not considered 
                                        ‘lady-like’ and were unconventional in their behaviour and interests, making them 
                                        rare portrayals of female characters for their time.<sup>4</sup> In 20th century media The 
                                        Bookworm and her unconventionality only increased in popularity, with Velma from 
                                        Scooby-Doo<sup>5</sup> and Harry Potter’s Hermione Granger<sup>6</sup> being some of the most iconic 
                                        characters from recent pop-culture.

                                    Intelligence, or more specifically intelligence in women, was seen  not only a rare trait in 
                                    antiquity but also as a characteristic that may have led to her being seen as undesirable 
                                    to men, as intelligence generally went hand in hand with an increase in independence and 
                                    free-thought.<sup>5</sup> Consequently, this meant women may have been less easier to control, 
                                    therefore many  Bookworm archetypal figures were written or depicted as prudish or as 
                                    actively seeking to maintain their virginity as this ‘purity’ may perhaps have been a way 
                                    to explain the fact that she was more unavailable to men due to her wisdom.<sup>6</sup>

                                        Poet Dorothy Parker once wrote, “Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses,” 
                                        but it seems that Hollywood took that a little too literally. Unfortunately, for 
                                        some reason, women wearing glasses and exhibiting signs of intelligence are instant 
                                        turn-offs to leading men of cinema. Worse still, much like Clark Kent’s super 
                                        effective disguise, no one even notices the pretty girl behind the specs until the 
                                        ever-so-necessary make-over by the wise and popular beautification fairies. Pop 
                                        culture is constantly telling us, if you want to be loved, take off the glasses.<sup>7</sup>

                                        One of the down sides  in recent media of The Bookworm however is the way she is 
                                        portrayed as someone who needs ‘fixing’ while she is also praised as in her 
                                        rejection of stereotypically feminine things because she is intelligent. This 
                                        dichotomy can typically be seen in many teen rom-coms that became popular in the 
                                        90s, wherein the smart, bookish or even ‘nerdy’ female character who has no 
                                        interest in dating, shopping, etc, undergoes a makeover that generally amounts 
                                        to her taking off her glasses, straightening her hair and wearing a tighter outfit. 
                                        This then leads to the male protagonist to fall in love with her because she is 
                                        finally conventionally ‘beautiful’ while also being ‘not-like-other-girls’ as she 
                                        does not share in their ‘shallow’ feminine interests (see She’s All That).<sup>8</sup> This 
                                        presents the idea that women should always strive to fit under a standard of beauty, 
                                        however if they do so intentionally they are seen as shallow or vapid, and that the 
                                        enjoyment of stereotypically feminine things such as makeup, interest in fashion, etc, 
                                        is seen in a derisive light so women should have interests outside of those things to 
                                        be seen as multi-dimensional or ‘not-like-other-girls.’<sup>9</sup></br></br>

                                        In Ancient Greek writing and poetry for example, one of the many virtues of 
                                        the Goddess Athena that are emphasised aside from her wisdom is her virginity. 
                                        In Homer’s Hymn to Aphrodite Five, she is set apart from the Goddess of Love 
                                        and seen as someone who can’t be seduced or “ensnared” because she is too 
                                        interested in “wars and in the work of Ares, in strifes and battles and in
                                        preparing famous crafts.”<sup>6</sup> On one hand this may be empowering, as it shows that 
                                        a woman in antiquity times was respected and worshipped for specialising in 
                                        something so typically male-dominated such as warfare,<sup>7</sup> however on the other 
                                        hand it could be implied that this talent Athena had only applied to her because 
                                        she had no interest in sex or romance like Aphrodite, meaning in antiquity women 
                                        were only valued and allowed to have interest in one or the other - sex or no sex, 
                                        intelligence or romance, etc. Similar to the Madonna-Whore complex, one is seen as 
                                        virtuous and smart because of her chastity, and the other not (but no less cunning) 
                                        as she is promiscous and actively engages and enjoys sex.<sup>8</sup>

                            <p>The Enchantress is a sub-archetype of The Crone in the realm of women who practice magic, 
                                however she differs from The Witch and The Oracle as her magical abilities are 
                                intrinsically tied to her sexuality, desirability and seductiveness, and many of 
                                the characters are depicted as evil or morally neutral in archaic and ancient times 
                                due to these two defining character traits. Some of the earliest examples of The 
                                Enchantress are the sorceress Circe from Greek myth, wherein she seduced Odysseus 
                                and his men and turned them into pigs to keep them on her island,<sup>1</sup> or Morgan Le Fay 
                                from the Arthurian Legend, who in fact had many iterations of her character depending 
                                on the source, however is most well-known for being an adversary of King Arthur as she 
                                is instrumental in his downfall and instigates the rift between Arthur and his wife, 
                                Queen Guinevere.<sup>2</sup> These two women showcase the tie between women and witchcraft, as 
                                well as female sexuality and the fear of it,<sup>3</sup> as they use their powers to enchant men 
                                to their downfall, therefore defining The Enchantress as a sub-archetype.

                                    The Enchantress in more recent media, due to her skillset, has primarily existed only 
                                    in stories of fantasy and, following in the same vein as her historical counterparts, 
                                    usually play a villainous role in them. Two french movies released in 1962 and 2000, 
                                    Where The Truth Lies (Maléfices) and Kirikou and The Sorceress portray their 
                                    enchantresses in this way - Kariba The Sorceress in Kirikou has her power emphasised 
                                    in the very fantastical and psychedelic art style of the animated film,2 and Myriam 
                                    Heller’s seduction of the male protagonist and her vindictive personality which leads 
                                    to his and his wife’s downfall in Maléfices is emphasised in the film’s noir-style, 
                                    the mysteries surrounding his wife’s misfortune and the antagonist shrouded in darkness 
                                    highlighted in the dramatic lighting.<sup>3</sup>

                                The fear of female sexuality and the consequent vilification of it is a prominent 
                                motif in tales that feature The Enchantress as the stories feature sorceresses 
                                or women that not only enchant men with their magic, but also with their beauty 
                                for self-motivated or malignant motivations, causing men to become victims or 
                                slaves to female seduction. Witchcraft and magic therefore becomes tied to 
                                femininity in this way as it is perhaps used as a another metaphor in how women 
                                use their bodies for evil,<sup>5</sup> and similar to The Madonna-Whore complex, female 
                                beauty and sexuality is something that is celebrated, but only under specific 
                                circumstances - women who are outwardly promiscuous are evil and use their 
                                beauty for bad, whereas ones who are chaste and are innocent about their looks are ‘good.’<sup>6</sup>

                                <br></br>

	                            There are some examples of Enchantress figures that do not fall under the 
                                evil-doer trope. The Oya Orisha from Yoruba tradition is a goddess (or Oya) 
                                that uses magic, often disguising herself to trick and be accepted into male 
                                dominated spaces, however she is a divinity that is also venerated for her 
                                guardianship of the Underworld, as well as her prowess as a warrior<sup>7</sup> - like 
                                with Circe, she or her magical abilities are not relegated solely to evil as 
                                tales of her skills go beyond that of seducing men alike with Circe and 
                                enchanting others to do her bidding.

                                    Comic books are a popular medium of where this sub-archetype is featured - characters like Marvel’s 
                                    Amora (literally nicknamed The Enchantress),<sup>4</sup> Lady Loki and Scarlet Witch, or DC Comic’s Raven 
                                    all fitting under this archetype, however they have been developed since archaic times. Amora 
                                    and Lady Loki fit The Enchantress as a dangerous seductress trope, Loki in particular an 
                                    interesting case as they are technically not biologically female, however when they become 
                                    female presenting they are instantly depicted as far more seductive.<sup>5</sup> Despite this there is 
                                    depth to them other than ‘female-magic-user-bad’ as Loki is a very layered character, more-so 
                                    an anti-hero than a villain,<sup>6</sup> meaning The Enchantress character has been subverted as there 
                                    has been concrete added to their motivations and story. Scarlet Witch7 and Raven8 are further 
                                    examples of this subversion as they go through story arcs that villainize them, however since 
                                    they are morally aligned as ‘good,’ they are Enchantresses that stray outside of their defined 
                                    stereotypes due to their depth.

                                    Interestingly, a common trope found in religious text and folklore from global cultures is the idea 
                                    that women are more inclined to possess psychic ability than men, specifically the powers of divination 
                                    and the gift of prophecy/seeing the future. The concept of The Three Fates (or the Moirai) from Greek 
                                    mythology, three women who tell the past, present and future in cryptic prophecy,<sup>1</sup> has been found or 
                                    replicated in other major polytheistic religions, such as in the Norse<sup>2</sup> or Celtic pantheons,<sup>3</sup> and women 
                                    who claim to communicate with a higher power that results in her seeing the future in archaic times 
                                    (and even in the present) were actually used as legitimate truth telling devices, such as the Oracles 
                                    in Ancient Greece<sup>4</sup> or the Mapuchi Shamans in South America.<sup>5</sup>

                                    She predicts that ‘by Cocytus and the banks of Acheron, I think, I soon must chant my prophecies.’  
                                    Considering the above tirade and most of her wailing in Aeschylus’ Agamemnon, we might be persuaded

                                    <p> Similar to The Enchantress, The Oracle in modern and contemporary media also lives primarily in 
                                        stories of fantasy, however due to the existence of actual psychics and mediums in real life, 
                                        some can be seen in tales that are more grounded in realism (an example could be tv shows 
                                        centred around police and how they sometimes may use psychics to help in catching a criminal).<sup>1</sup> 
                                        Another similarity modern versions of this sub-archetype has with its historical counterparts 
                                        are how many Oracle characters are mired in tragedy or misery. Like Cassandra, women who can see 
                                        the future in film or tv are usually portrayed as very troubled or haunted as they predict horrible 
                                        things that are just vague enough that it is difficult to prevent them, and seeing into the future 
                                        is never used as a narrative device to move the plot forward in a happy way for the characters, 
                                        only one for doom.<sup>2</sup>

                                        Women who fall under this trope, at least in western myths and folklore, either cut very tragic or 
                                        ominous figures - Cassandra was blessed with the gift of prophecy, however because she rejected 
                                        Apollo’s sexual advances it became a curse, as no one would listen or believe her predictions. 
                                        She predicted the fall of Troy and her own demise, however due to no one believing her and her 
                                        lack of agency as a woman at the time, she was doomed regardless, her prophecies coming true and 
                                        her powerless to stop it.<sup>7</sup> The White Buffalo Calf Woman from Lakota folklore is an example of a 
                                        woman who is actually believed  in her ability, depicted more as a supernatural and sacred figure, 
                                        appearing to men to give warnings or advice on how to save their tribes from problems such as famine.<sup>8</sup>

                                        In the terms of psychic predictions from Oracles of Shamans being used in real life and properly believed, 
                                        with the power of hind sight and better understanding of scientific developments, these beliefs and 
                                        prophecies can be put under a far more critical lens and be explained thanks to the power of hind-sight 
                                        and a better understanding of science. It is thought today that The Oracles of Delphi - or the Pythia - 
                                        who were also believed to be chosen by Apollo, may have gotten their visions from schizophrenia or other 
                                        mental illnesses which causes hallucinations,<sup>9</sup> or because of the fumes or drugs released in prophetic

                                        The overwhelming preference toward women  over men in the way of psychic ability has also persisted from 
                                        antiquity to current lore. There are many male characters that possess this ability, especially in the 
                                        world of superheroes and comic books, however the vast majority of people in media who have the gist of 
                                        prophecy are still women. This preference is not only rooted in the historical lore, however due to 
                                        further study of the subject, this gender bias has only been confirmed and reasoned by a pool of scientific 
                                        research. It was discovered that, generally, women are more inclined to be more superstitious and believe 
                                        in the supernatural more than men,<sup>4</sup> and the way in which women think about the future is in fact more 
                                        negative and fatalistic than the way men do.<sup>5</sup>

	                                    This may explain why so many female Oracle characters are harbingers and messangers of doom instead of 
                                        happiness, such as Cordelia Chase’s visions (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) only being 
                                        focused on how people are going to get injured in some way at a later time,<sup>6</sup> or Teen Wolf’s Lydia Martins’ 
                                        cryptic and vague predictions of the future that are only used when something extremely bad is going to 
                                        happen to the cast in the next episode or so.<sup>7</sup>

                                <p>When the word ‘shrew’ is used to describe a woman, it usually means the woman is someone who is 
                                    belligerent, ill-tempered, scolding and definitely not ‘traditionally obedient.’ This particular
                                    use of was popularised by one of William Shakespeare’s plays, The Taming of The Shrew,<sup>1</sup> 
                                    which tells a story about a man named Luciento who wishes to marry a woman named Bianca, however 
                                    she is forbidden to do so until her “shrewish” older sister Katherine is married off first. An 
                                    arrogant and greedy Petruchio vows to marry her (as he wants her dowry), and at the end of the 
                                    play Kate (Katherine) has been subdued (or ‘tamed’) by Petruchio’s many tactics,  moulded into the 
                                    perfect wife - loving, pleasant and most importantly completely obedient to her husband.<sup>2</sup>

                                    <br></br>

                                    Both Katherine and her husband are far from perfect - she is prone to verbally and physically abusing 
                                    others and Petruchio is manipulative and borderline psychologically/physically abusive to Katherine 
                                    (such as starving her to earn her love and gratitude) however what we may consider to be problematic 
                                    in the present day is that all of this behaviour is supposed to be seen in a comedic light.<sup>3</sup> The 
                                    audience is encouraged to laugh at the abuse as they see a prideful and haughty woman be ‘put in her
                                    place,’ and feel triumph with Petruchio when Katherine has finally been beaten down to the so-called 
                                    perfect wife.<sup>4</sup> This play consequently demonstrates the harmful and misoginystic roots the word ‘shrew’ 
                                    is derived from, as well as the attitudes historical societies had toward certain types of women at the 
                                    time.

                                        persisted into modern and contemporary media, especially in teen rom-coms and tv.<sup>1</sup> The 1999 film

                                        and while the methods used by Heath Ledger’s character, Patrick (ie Petruchio) to ‘tame’ Kat 
                                        (Katherine) are far less manipulative and definitely do not fall under the realm of abuse, the 
                                        final message of the film is still the same centuries later - Kat was unhappy and belligerent 
                                        until she fell in love with a man, and it is with the power of man’s love that Kat is ‘saved 
                                        from herself,’ and her cynicism, as well as transforming her personality into what is considered

                                    must be “tamed” through a combination of physical and mental abuse. Necessary tools may include

                                    their pre-decided roles in life dates far before from Shakespeare’s time. In Ancient Greek mythology, 
                                    the Goddess Artemis (or Diana), while not depicted as stereotypically ‘shrewish,’ is a deity that was 
                                    generally ambivalent toward men, believing that the male gender was something she could happily live 
                                    without.<sup>6</sup> This did not mean she hated everyone of the opposite sex - in fact, she even fell in love 
                                    with one or two (such as Orion),<sup>7</sup> however she was very quick to punish men who she felt had crossed 
                                    her and was wrathful and ruthless in her vengeance. Acteon, for example, was a hunter who accidentally 
                                    came across Artemis bathing, and in return she turned him into a stag and he was hunted and gruesomely 
                                    killed by his own hunting dogs.<sup>8</sup>
                                    
                                    <br></br>

	                                What differentiates Artemis from  Katherine however is that Artemis is never viewed as a woman who 
                                    needs to be ‘tamed.’ Of course, she is a Goddess, therefore it would be impossible for any mortal 
                                    (or immortal) man to even attempt it, however she is generally celebrated for her dedication to the 
                                    hunt, her skill with the bow and arrow and her lack of interest toward the romantic, and her acts 
                                    of vengeance toward men are framed more as for-warnings instead of bad and disobedient behaviour 
                                    of a ‘shrewish’ woman.<sup>9</sup>

                                        Despite the repetitive trope, uncouth, loud-mouthed and morally flawed women have become a 
                                        beloved staple in modern media. These characters are usually deeply flawed as people, 
                                        however they are not fixed by a love of a man or a man taming her ‘unfeminine’ personality. 
                                        Eleanor Shellstrop from The Good Place is a self-described “trash bag from Arizona,” 
                                        starting out as selfish and narcissistic, however viewers root for her as a character 
                                        because her journey develops her into someone who is far more well-rounded. She retains 
                                        her loud-mouthed and rebellious attitude, however she is also someone who became far less 
                                        selfish, is fiercely loyal to her friends and learnt to become a morally ‘good’ person who 
                                        ends up saving the afterlife.<sup>3</sup> Yes, a lot of her self-improvement was influenced by Chidi, 
                                        her male love interest, however her femininity (or her lack of what people may consider 
                                        ideal feminine behaviour) was never seen as the main issue like in The Taming of The Shrew.<sup>4</sup>
                                        Her flaws are not dependant on her gender, and she became a kinder person without sacrificing 
                                        her original personality.

                            <p>The Wise Old Woman is perhaps the sub-archetype that fits the stereotypical image of The Crone the best. 
                                These figures are women who are no longer deemed  beautiful or romantically or sexually viable due to 
                                their age, and in religious and folkloric space generally fall under an advice giving or mentor role to 
                                the younger protagonist, or the villain of the tale. 

                                <br></br>

                                The first distinction can be seen by The Three Fates, and although they are sometimes depicted as women 
                                of different ages (Mother, Maiden, Crone) the popular belief is that they are three older women who give 
                                cryptic or ominous advice about the past, present and future. They are wise in their power of prophecy 
                                that no one else possesses.<sup>1</sup>  The Fairy Godmother in Cinderella was also initially depicted as an 
                                older-woman who acts as a kind mentor to Cinderella, helping her out of her life of abuse with her 
                                magical powers.<sup>2</sup> Wise old women as villains on the other hand can be seen in Norse mythology, such as 
                                Elli fighting the hero god Thor,<sup>3</sup> the tales of the Baba Yaga from Slavic folklore4 and how in Japanese 
                                yokai-stories, many evil demons are depicted as ‘old hags.’<sup>5</sup>

                                <p>The Wise Old Woman as a trope had only started to be explored in further depth during the 20th/21st century, 
                                    with many older female characters in falling under the same constraints since archaic times.

                                    Miranda Priestly from the from the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada fulfils both the mentor role 
                                    as well as the antagonistic one, as she is one of the most powerful figures in the fashion industry 
                                    that everyone respects and envies, however she had to become ruthlessly ambitious to reach that point.<sup>1</sup>
                                    She treats her employees cruelly and is comfortable throwing her friends under the bus for her career, 
                                    however unlike typical folkloric characters, the film gives her further depth other than being evil 
                                    for the sake of being evil as it shows how she became this way and the downsides of her ambition. 
                                    She had to become cut throat to climb the ranks as of such a competitive industry,<sup>2</sup> however her 
                                    marriage is falling apart and she seems to have a strained relationship with her young daughters 
                                    because of the prioritisation of her career and her inability to manage work-life balance.<sup>3</sup>

                                    is her duality, sometimes as an almost-heroine, sometimes as a villain, and her rich, earthy evocation 
                                    of womanhood. "Baba Yaga still remains one of the most ambiguous, cunning, and clever women of folklore," 
                                    says Ryan. "[She] commands fear and respect, and simultaneously awe and desire. I admire her carelessness 
                                    and her independence, even her cruelty, and in a world where women are so often reduced to hazy blurs of 
                                    inconsequence, she is a figure that reminds us that we are ferocious and untameable, and that such 
                                    freedoms often come at a cost.”<sup>6</sup>

                                the importance many societies place on youth, as well as the universal fear of age or more specifically the 
                                fear of ageing and what that does to a woman and her social value.<sup>7</sup> If it has been defined in previous 
                                archetypes that one way women are valued is their physical appearance and how beautiful they are percieved 
                                to be, then they would lose that characteristic as signs of advanced age are generally not considered 
                                something to be conventionally beautiful (wrinkles, grey hairs, weathered skin, etc).<sup>8</sup> Older women may be 
                                a physical manifestation of this fear to some, and that is why they have been villainized in so many stories.<sup>9</sup>

	                            These ‘evil’ characters are not so black and white however. They are also usually very wise, shrewd and 
                                intelligent, and some choose to help the protagonist depending on the context at the time. The Baba Yaga 
                                for example has some stories where she cooks and eats children, however is also inclined to offer advice 
                                and acts more as a trickster character than someone outright malignant.<sup>10</sup>

                                    One genre that older women have been frequently placed in is comedy, with many sitcoms centred around 
                                    female friendships at an older age and how they handle situations that are unique to that age group 
                                    only. Golden Girls was an American sitcom that ran from 1985-1992 which was about a group of very 
                                    different women in their golden years living together in Miami and getting into comedic situations 
                                    that one can only experience at that age.<sup>4</sup> Netflix’s 2015-2022 show Grace and Frankie has a similar 
                                    premise - two women  that are polar opposites are forced together after their husbands leave them for 
                                    one another, and at the end their friendship and love for each other becomes their strongest and most 
                                    valued relationship.<sup>5</sup> Grace and Frankie also takes the steps to explore being newly single, dating 
                                    and navigating your sex life as a 70 year old woman, which are themes that are generally taboo when 
                                    in relation to older female characters,<sup>6</sup> which signify a change in how The Wise Old Woman is perceived 
                                    and how, despite their age (or because of it), these subjects don’t just disappear.

                                The Witch differs from the other magical / supernatural sub-archetypes of The Crone (The Enchantress and 
                                The Oracle) as witches are far less specialised in their magical abilities, less gender specific and often 
                                depicted as dabbling in the more macabre and object-focused side of the supernatural.<sup>1</sup> Witches are often 
                                far less glamorous or seductive as enchantresses as although beautiful and dangerous witches such as 
                                Aradia<sup>2</sup> exist in the lore, their magic is not solely confined to this characterisitc, the seduction of men 
                                not their main source of power.<sup>3</sup> This also applies to The Oracle, and how there are examples of witches 
                                who possess similar prophetic ability, again they aren’t defined by this power, and it is likely that 
                                witches that can see the future do not possess latent natural ability, but however need to activate it 
                                using some sort of physical or verbal manifestation, such as a potion or a spell.<sup>4</sup>

                                warts was a popular depiction of witches in contemporary media, with this image becoming one of the most 
                                stereotypical ways in which a Witch could be presented.The Wicked Witch of The West  (Elphaba) from the 1939 film 
                                The Wizard of Oz represents this perfectly, her green skin only empathising how evil she is supposed to be as it 
                                is another feature that glaringly separates her from the rest of the citizens of Oz.<sup>1</sup> However what is different 
                                from The Wizard of Oz’s is how the show separates witchcraft into ‘white’ and ‘black’ magic. Elphaba practices 
                                ‘black’ magic, which is therefore evil and corrupt, reflected in her character design (green skin, black clothes, 
                                deformed features. Her sister Glinda however is presented as a beautiful blonde woman wearing an extravagant pink 
                                dress who practices ‘white’ magic, which is ‘pure’ and ‘good.’<sup>2</sup> This concept of witchcraft with different moral 
                                alignments has become a popular one in modern media, and can be found in more movies such as Ghibli’s 2001 
                                Spirited Away, the dichotomy also represented by two sisters.<sup>3</sup>

                            As the practice of witchcraft was something that existed in real life (results not withstanding), many people in 
                            christian communities feared it as they thought it was a Satanic practice, and began to harshly condemn it.<sup>5</sup> 
                            During the 14th-15th centuries in small towns and communities in colonial America and Europe, things escalated to 
                            the point that any woman who was deemed suspicious was drowned, immolated or executed if there was the slightest 
                            whisper that she may have been a witch.<sup>6</sup> The way in which they were accused and ‘tested’ for sorcery was never 
                            concrete, targeting women who may have been outcasts in some way - living alone, advanced age, different 
                            ethnicity/race (see Tituba)<sup>7</sup> - and blaming them for the town’s misfortunes that with hindsight can say were probably 
                            not caused by witchcraft but something more scientifically viable.<sup>8</sup> Due to these real world events, witches in western 
                            history that were shaped by the Christian narrative are generally portrayed as evil, conniving women of all ages who 
                            sacrifice animals and children for their spells and potions.

                            A more nuanced portrayal of witches in folklore existed before the religious and puritanical fear-mongering became 
                            the controlling narrative, and that was the depiction of witches in Celtic and Welsh mythology.<sup>9</sup> Cerridwen is a 
                            witch from welsh lore that cuts a figure as a loving mother as well as a ruthless pursuer of justice, and is the 
                            origin for the link between witches and cauldrons,<sup>10</sup> showing how originally, witches were multi-dimensional 
                            figures that became feared due to their unconventionality, religious rebellion and how they represent the fear of 
                            the unknown.

                                “In one part of the Mabinogion, which is the cycle of myths found in Welsh legend, Cerridwen brews up a potion in 
                                her magical cauldron to give to her son Afagddu (Morfran). She puts young Gwion in charge of guarding the cauldron, 
                                but three drops of the brew fall upon his finger, blessing him with the knowledge held within. Cerridwen pursues 
                                Gwion through a cycle of seasons until, in the form of a hen, she swallows Gwion, disguised as an ear of corn. 
                                Nine months later, she gives birth to Taliesen, the greatest of all the Welsh poets.” <sup>10</sup>

                                Witches have also become staples in recent pop-culture - starting from the 1980s - due to the rise and 
                                popularity of goth / punk fashion in young adult communities and the love of the macabre and the dark to 
                                go with it.<sup>4</sup> Many witch characters from very famous movies such as Elvira, Mistress of The Dark<sup>5</sup> or Wednesday 
                                and Morticia Addams<sup>6</sup> were unapologetically goth in their style, which appealed to many teenage girls in 
                                particular as gothic fashion became a way they could express themselves better as mainstream fashion may 
                                not have accurately represented who they felt they were inside.<sup>7</sup>

                            Witches in film from the early 90s also became extremely popular in predominately female queer spaces as many movies 
                            about the modern witch reflected the struggles of young, queer people at the time. Movies such as The Craft depicting 
                            a young group of girls who were ostracised from their wider community due to their interest in witchcraft, and, 
                            like with many queer communities, found comfort and safety in their ‘coven’ (a group of friends) after their biological 
                            families rejected or misunderstood them for something they couldn’t control.<sup>8</sup> Witchcraft in recent media has therefore 
                            unwittingly become a metaphor for the queer experience, and many found comfort in that.
