                                        of her brilliant mind, wit and intelligence. This trait warranted significance 
                                        in antiquity as a woman was generally not encouraged to be overtly 
                                        knowledgable or educated - her main priority was to be married off and bearing 
                                        children by her early 20s,<sup>2</sup> the realm of intelligence reserved solely for 
                                        men. Therefore it can be seen by female divinities such as the Greek Goddess <b class="n">Athena,</b> 
                                        who was worshipped for her unparalleled wisdom and skills at war strategy,<sup>3</sup> or the 
                                        Mesopotamian Goddess of writing and accounting, <b class="n">Nisaba,<sup>4</sup></b> that intelligence in women 
                                        was a trait significant enough to warrant attention, especially ones who presided over a 
                                        typically male dominated field because of how rare of a trait is was in every-day life.

                                        modern and contemporary media as conversations around female empowerment and equality has 
                                        increased.<sup>1</sup> Characters in 19-20th century western literature such as <b class="n">Pride and 
                                        Prejudice’s Elizabeth Bennet<sup>2</sup></b> were beloved as they showcased spunky, well-educated 
                                        female characters that deviated from the typical damsel in distress stereotype that 
                                        so many women were restricted too during this time period.<sup>3</sup> They were not considered 
                                        ‘lady-like’ and were unconventional in their behaviour and interests, making them 
                                        rare portrayals of female characters for their time.<sup>4</sup> In 20th century media <b class="n">The 
                                        Bookworm</b> and her unconventionality only increased in popularity, with <b class="n">Velma</b> from 
                                        <b class="n">Scooby-Doo<sup>5</sup></b> and <b class="n">Harry Potter’s Hermione Granger<sup>6</sup></b> being some of the most iconic 
                                        characters from recent pop-culture.

                                    Intelligence, or more specifically intelligence in women, was not only a rare trait in 
                                    antiquity but also something that may have led to her being seen as undesirable 
                                    to men, as an intelligent mind equaled an increase in independence and 
                                    free-thought, consequently making these women harder to control.<sup>5</sup>
                                    Many <b class="n">Bookworm</b> figures were therefore negatively depicted as more prudish or 
                                    proudly virginal as they prioritised their pursual of knowledge over the romantic / sexual 
                                    attentions of men.<sup>6</sup>

                                        Poet Dorothy Parker once wrote, “Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses,” 
                                        but it seems that Hollywood took that a little too literally. Unfortunately, for 
                                        some reason, women wearing glasses and exhibiting signs of intelligence are instant 
                                        turn-offs to leading men of cinema. Worse still, much like Clark Kent’s super 
                                        effective disguise, no one even notices the pretty girl behind the specs until the 
                                        ever-so-necessary make-over by the wise and popular beautification fairies. Pop 
                                        culture is constantly telling us, if you want to be loved, take off the glasses.<sup>7</sup>

                                        One of the down sides in recent media depictions of the <b class="n">The Bookworm</b> however is the way she is 
                                        portrayed as someone who needs ‘fixing’ while also being praised in her 
                                        rejection of stereotypically feminine things because she is intelligent. This 
                                        dichotomy can typically be seen in teen rom-coms that became popular in the 
                                        90s, wherein the smart, bookish, ‘nerdy’ female character who primarily has no 
                                        interest in stereo-typically feminine things such as dating or shopping,
                                        undergoes a makeover that generally amounts to her taking off her glasses, straightening her hair 
                                        and wearing a tighter-fitting outfit. This then leads to the male protagonist to fall in love 
                                        with her because she is finally deemed conventionally ‘beautiful’ and feminine while also being 
                                        ‘not-like-other-girls’ as she does not share in their ‘shallow’ feminine interests (see <b class="n">She’s All That</b>).<sup>8</sup> 
                                        This presents the idea that women should always strive to fit under a standard of beauty, 
                                        however if they do so intentionally they are seen as shallow or vapid, and that the 
                                        enjoyment of stereotypically feminine things such as makeup, interest in fashion, etc, 
                                        is seen in a derisive light, dictating that women should have interests outside of those things to 
                                        be seen as ‘not-like-other-girls.’<sup>9</sup></br></br>

                                        In Ancient Greek writing and poetry for example, one of the many virtues of 
                                        the Goddess <b class="n">Athena</b> that are emphasised aside from her wisdom is her virginity. 
                                        In Homer’s <b class="n">Hymn to Aphrodite Five,</b> she is set apart from the Goddess of Love 
                                        and written as someone who can’t be seduced or “ensnared” because she is too 
                                        interested in “wars and in the work of Ares, in strifes and battles and in
                                        preparing famous crafts.”<sup>6</sup> On one hand this may be empowering, as it shows that 
                                        a woman in antiquity was respected and worshipped for specialising in 
                                        something so typically male-dominated such as warfare.<sup>7</sup> On the other 
                                        hand it could be implied that this talent <b class="n">Athena</b> had only applied to her because 
                                        she had no interest in sex or romance like <b class="n">Aphrodite,</b> meaning in antiquity women 
                                        were only allowed to have interest in one or the other - sex or no sex, 
                                        intelligence or romance, etc, or else they would not be valued. Similar to the <b class="n">Madonna-Whore complex,</b> 
                                        one is seen as virtuous and smart because of her chastity, and the other not (but no less cunning) 
                                        as she is promiscous and actively engages in and enjoys sex.<sup>8</sup>

                                however she differs from The Witch and The Oracle as her magical abilities are 
                                intrinsically tied to her sexuality, desirability and seductiveness, and many of 
                                the characters are depicted as evil or morally neutral in archaic and ancient times 
                                due to these two defining character traits. Some of the earliest examples of <b class="n">The 
                                Enchantress</b> are the sorceress <b class="n">Circe</b> from Greek myth, who seduced Odysseus 
                                and his men and turned them into pigs to keep them on her island.<sup>1</sup><b class="n">Morgan Le Fay</b> 
                                from the <b class="n">Arthurian Legend,</b> who although had many iterations of her character depending 
                                on the source, is also most well-known for being an adversary of King Arthur as she 
                                is instrumental in his downfall and instigates the rift between Arthur and his wife, 
                                <b class="n">Queen Guinevere.<sup>2</sup></b> These two women showcase the tie between women and witchcraft to
                                female sexuality and the fear of it,<sup>3</sup> as they use their powers to enchant men 
                                to their downfall, therefore defining <b class="n">The Enchantress</b> as a sub-archetype.

                                <b class="n">The Enchantress</b> in more recent media, due to her skillset, has primarily existed only 
                                    in stories of fantasy and, following in the same vein as her historical counterparts, 
                                    usually play a villainous role in them. Two french movies released in 1962 and 2000,

                                The fear of female sexuality and the consequent vilification of it is a prominent 
                                motif in tales that feature <b class="n">The Enchantress</b> as the stories feature sorceresses 
                                that enchant men with their magic for self-motivated or malignant motivations, using their bodies and sexualities as their main source, 
                                causing men to become victims / hapless slaves to female seduction. Witchcraft and magic therefore became tied to 
                                female sexuality in this way as it is another metaphor in how self-aware women who use their bodies in this way are evil.
                                <sup>5</sup> Similar to <b class="n">The Madonna-Whore complex,</b> female 
                                beauty and sexuality is therefore something that is celebrated, but only under specific 
                                circumstances - women who are outwardly promiscuous and are aware of their so called 'power' that their bodies have over men are evil,
                                whereas ones who are chaste and are innocent about their looks are morally good.<sup>6</sup>

                                <br></br>

	                            There are some examples of <b class="n">Enchantress</b> figures that do not fall under the 
                                evil-doer trope. The <b class="n">Oya Orisha</b> from Yoruba tradition is a goddess (or Oya) 
                                that uses magic, often disguising herself to trick and be accepted into male 
                                dominated spaces, however she is a divinity that is also venerated for her 
                                guardianship of the Underworld, as well as her prowess as a warrior<sup>7</sup> - unlike 
                                <b class="n">Circe,</b> she or her magical abilities are not relegated solely to evil as 
                                tales of her skills go beyond that of seducing men and 
                                enchanting others to do her bidding.

                                    Comic books are a popular medium of where this sub-archetype is featured - characters like Marvel’s 
                                    <b class="n">Amora</b> (literally nicknamed <b class="n">The Enchantress),<sup>4</sup> Lady Loki</b> and <b class="n">Scarlet Witch,</b> or DC Comic’s <b class="n">Raven</b> 
                                    all fitting under this archetype, however they have been developed since archaic times. <b class="n">Amora</b> 
                                    and <b class="n">Lady Loki</b> fit <b class="n">The Enchantress</b> as a dangerous seductress trope, <b class="n">Loki</b> in particular an 
                                    interesting case as they are technically not biologically female, however when they become 
                                    female presenting they are instantly depicted as a far more sexualised version of themselves.<sup>5</sup> Despite this 
                                    there is depth to Loki other than ‘female-magic-user-bad,’ as <b class="n">Loki</b> is a very layered character, acting 
                                    more as an anti-hero than a villain.<sup>6</sup> <b class="n">The Enchantress</b> trope has therefore been subverted as 
                                    there is further nuance to Loki's character as their main source of magic is not rooted in the seduction of men, and their
                                    moral alignent is not completely on the side of evil. <b class="n">Scarlet Witch<sup>7</sup></b> and <b class="n">Raven<sup>8</sup></b> 
                                    are further examples of this subversion as although they go through story arcs that villainize them, since 
                                    they are morally aligned as ‘good,’ they are <b class="n">Enchantresses</b> that stray outside of the defined 
                                    stereotypes due to their stories existing outside of the seducation of men and their morally 'good' natures.

                                    Interestingly, a common trope found in religious text and folklore from global cultures is the idea 
                                    that women are more inclined to possess psychic ability than men, specifically the powers of divination 
                                    and the gift of prophecy / seeing the future. The concept of  <b class="n">The Three Fates</b> (or the 
                                    <b class="n">Moirai)</b> from Greek mythology, three women who tell the past, present and future in cryptic prophecy,
                                    <sup>1</sup> has been found or replicated in other major polytheistic religions, such as in the Norse<sup>2</sup> 
                                    or Celtic pantheons,<sup>3</sup> and women who claim to communicate with a higher power that results in her seeing 
                                    the future in archaic times (and even in the present) were actually used as legitimate truth telling devices, 
                                    such as the <b class="n">Oracles of Delphi</b> in Ancient Greece<sup>4</sup> or the <b class="n">Mapuchi Shamans</b>

                                        stories of fantasy, however due to the existence of self-proclaimed psychics and mediums in real life, 
                                        some can be seen in tales that are more grounded in realism (an example could be tv shows

                                        Apollo’s sexual advances her gift became a curse, as no-one would listen or believe her predictions. 
                                        She predicted the fall of Troy and her own demise, but due to no-one believing her and her 
                                        lack of agency as a woman, she was doomed, her prophecies coming true despite her forewarnings and

                                        Psychic predictions from Oracles or Shamans in archaic times were taken seriously as they were believed to be
                                        divine interventions, however with the power of hind sight and better understanding of science discoveries, these
                                        prophecies can now be put under a far more critical lens and be rationalised. It is thought today that <b class="n">

                                        The overwhelming preference of women over men in the way of psychic ability has also persisted from 
                                        antiquity to current lore. There are male fictional characters that possess this ability, especially in the 
                                        world of superheroes and comic books, however the vast majority of people in media who have the gift of 
                                        prophecy are still women. This preference is not only rooted in the historical lore, and due to 
                                        further study of the subject, this gender bias has been explained by scientific 
                                        research. It was discovered that, generally, women are more inclined to be more superstitious and believe 
                                        in the supernatural more than men,<sup>4</sup> and the way in which women think about the future is in fact more 
                                        negative and fatalistic than the way men do.<sup>5</sup>

	                                    This may explain why so many Oracle characters are harbingers and messangers of doom instead of 
                                        happiness. <b class="n">Cordelia Chase’s</b> visions (from <b class="n">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</b> and <b class="n">Angel</b>) only

                                        cryptic and vague predictions were only brought up when something extremely dire was going to

                                <p>When the word ‘shrew’ is used to describe a woman, it means the woman is someone who is 
                                    belligerent, ill-tempered, scolding and definitely not ‘traditionally obedient.’ This particular
                                    use of the word was popularised by one of William Shakespeare’s plays, <b class="n">The Taming of The Shrew,<sup>1</sup></b> 
                                    which tells a story about a man named Luciento who wishes to marry a woman named <b class="n">Bianca,</b> however 
                                    she is forbidden to do so until her “shrewish” older sister <b class="n">Katherine</b> is married off first. An 
                                    arrogant and greedy Petruchio vows to marry her (as he wants her dowry), and at the end of the 
                                    play <b class="n">Kate</b> (Katherine) has been subdued (or ‘tamed’) by Petruchio’s many tactics, moulded into the 
                                    perfect wife - loving, pleasant and most importantly obedient to her husband.<sup>2</sup>

                                    <br></br>

                                    Both <b class="n">Katherine</b> and her husband are far from perfect - she is prone to verbally and physically abusing 
                                    others and Petruchio is manipulative and borderline psychologically / physically abusive to <b class="n">Katherine</b>
                                    (such as starving her to earn her love and gratitude). However what we may consider to be most problematic 
                                    in the present day is that all of Petruchio's behaviour is supposed to be seen in a comedic light.<sup>3</sup> The 
                                    audience is encouraged to laugh at Petruchio's abuse as they see a prideful and haughty woman be ‘put in her
                                    place,’ and feel triumph alongside her husband when <b class="n">Katherine</b> has finally been beaten down to be the so-called 
                                    perfect wife.<sup>4</sup> This play consequently demonstrates the harmful and misoginystic roots the word ‘shrew’ 
                                    is derived from, as well as the attitudes historical societies had toward certain types of women at the 
                                    time.

                                        persisted into modern and contemporary media, especially in teen rom-coms and tv.<sup>1</sup> The 1999 film

                                    value, the play proposes that desirable women are quiet and submissive, whereas women with spirit

                                    The trope in western cultures of the out-spoken and ‘badly-behaved’ woman who resisted and rejected 
                                    their pre-determined roles in life date much earlier from Shakespeare’s time. In Ancient Greek mythology, 
                                    the Goddess <b class="n">Artemis</b> (or <b class="n">Diana</b>), while not depicted as stereotypically ‘shrewish,’ 
                                    is a deity who was generally ambivalent toward men, believing that the masculine gender was something she could 
                                    happily live without.<sup>6</sup> This did not mean she hated everyone of the opposite sex - in fact, she fell in love 
                                    with one or two (such as Orion),<sup>7</sup> however she was very quick to punish men who she felt had crossed 
                                    her, and was wrathful and ruthless in her vengeance. Acteon, for example, was a hunter who accidentally 
                                    came across <b class="n">Artemis</b> bathing, and in punishment she turned him into a stag and he was chased and gruesomely 
                                    killed by his own hunting dogs.<sup>8</sup>
                                    
                                    <br></br>

	                                What differentiates <b class="n">Artemis</b> from <b class="n">Katherine</b> however is that <b class="n">Artemis</b> 
                                    is never really viewed as a woman who needed to be ‘tamed.’ Of course, she is a Goddess, therefore it would be 
                                    impossible for any mortal (or immortal) man to even attempt it, however she is generally celebrated for her 
                                    dedication to the hunt, her skill with the bow and arrow and her lack of interest toward the romantic, and her acts 
                                    of vengeance toward men are framed more as for-warnings instead of the bad and disobedient behaviour 
                                    of a ‘shrewish’ woman.<sup>9</sup>

                                        Despite it being a somewhat repetitive trope, uncouth, loud-mouthed and morally flawed women have become a 
                                        beloved staple in modern media. These characters are usually deeply flawed as people, 
                                        however in media post '90s, many are not fixed by a love of a man or a man taming her ‘unfeminine’ personality. 
                                        <b class="n">Eleanor Shellstrop</b> from <b class="n">The Good Place</b> is a self-described “trash bag from Arizona,” 
                                        starting out as selfish and narcissistic, however viewers root for her
                                        because her journey develops her into someone who is far more well-rounded. She retains 
                                        her loud-mouthed and rebellious attitude, however she is also someone who became far less 
                                        selfish, is fiercely loyal to her friends and learnt to become a morally ‘good’ person who 
                                        ends up saving the afterlife.<sup>3</sup> Yes, a lot of her self-improvement was influenced by Chidi, 
                                        her male love interest, however her femininity (or her lack of what people may consider 
                                        traditional feminine behaviour) was never seen as the primary issue like in <b class="n">The Taming of The Shrew.<sup>4</sup></b>
                                        Her flaws are not dependant on her gender, and she became a kinder person without sacrificing 
                                        her original personality.

                            <p><b class="n">The Wise Old Woman</b> is perhaps the sub-archetype that fits the stereotypical image of The Crone the best. 
                                These figures are women who are no longer deemed beautiful or romantically / sexually viable due to 
                                their age, and in religious and folkloric space generally fall under an advice giving or mentor role to 
                                the younger protagonist, or the villain of the tale. 

                                <br></br>

                                The first distinction can be seen by <b class="n">The Three Fates,</b> and although they are sometimes depicted as women 
                                of different ages (Mother, Maiden, Crone) the popular belief is that they are three older women who give 
                                cryptic or ominous predictions about the past, present and future. They are wise in their power of prophecy 
                                that no one else possesses.<sup>1</sup>  <b class="n">The Fairy Godmother</b> in <b class="n">Cinderella</b> is also 
                                depicted as an older-woman who acts as a kind mentor to Cinderella, helping her escape her life of abuse with her 
                                magical powers.<sup>2</sup> Wise old women as villains on the other hand can be seen in Norse mythology, such as 
                                <b class="n">Elli</b> fighting the hero god Thor,<sup>3</sup> the tales of the <b class="n">Baba Yaga</b> from Slavic 
                                folklore<sup>4</sup> and in Japanese yokai-stories, many evil demons are depicted as ‘old hags.’<sup>5</sup>

                                    says Ryan. "[She] commands fear and respect, and simultaneously awe and desire. I admire her carelessness 
                                    and her independence, even her cruelty, and in a world where women are so often reduced to hazy blurs of 
                                    inconsequence, she is a figure that reminds us that we are ferocious and untameable, and that such 
                                    freedoms often come at a cost.”<sup>6</sup>

                                The vilification of older women in religion and folklore is an interesting one. When so many archetypes that 
                                fall under the Maiden cateogry are usually deemed as virtuous and morally righteous, why is it so common that 
                                the older woman is relegated to a villainous role? An explanation could be the importance many societies have 
                                placed on youth, as well as the universal fear of ageing and what that does to a woman and her social value.<sup>7</sup> 
                                If it has been defined in previous archetypes that one major way women are valued is for their physical appearance 
                                and how beautiful they are percieved to be, then they would lose that value as signs of advanced age are generally 
                                not considered to be conventionally beautiful (wrinkles, grey hairs, weathered skin, etc).<sup>8</sup> 
                                Older women may be a physical manifestation of this fear to some, and that is why they have been villainized in so 
                                many stories.<sup>9</sup>

	                            These ‘evil’ characters are not so black and white however. They are also usually very wise, shrewd and 
                                intelligent, and some choose to help the protagonist depending on the context. <b class="n">The Baba Yaga</b> 
                                for example has some stories where she cooks and eats children, however is also inclined to offer advice 
                                and acts more as a trickster character than someone outright malignant.<sup>10</sup>

                                    One genre that older women have been frequently placed in is comedy, with many sitcoms centred around 
                                    female friendships at an older age and how they handle situations that are unique only to that age group. 
                                    <b class="n">Golden Girls</b> was an American sitcom that ran from 1985-1992, and was about a group of very 
                                    different women in their golden years living together in Miami and getting into comedic situations 
                                    that one can only experience at that age.<sup>4</sup> Netflix’s 2015-2022 show <b class="n">Grace and Frankie</b> has a similar 
                                    premise - two women that are polar opposites are forced together after their husbands leave them for 
                                    one another, and at the end their friendship and love for each other becomes their strongest and most 
                                    valued relationship.<sup>5</sup> <b class="n">Grace and Frankie</b> also takes the steps to explore being newly single, dating 
                                    and navigating your sex life as a 70-80 year old woman, which are themes that are generally taboo
                                    in relation to older female characters,<sup>6</sup> signifying a change in how <b class="n">The Wise Old Woman</b> is perceived 
                                    and how, despite their age (or because of it), these topics don’t just disappear.

                                The show dove into issues facing women of a certain age with brutal, hilarious honesty. Did anyone expect

                                <b class="n">The Witch</b> differs from the other magical / supernatural sub-archetypes of The Crone (The Enchantress 
                                and The Oracle) as witches are far less specialised in their magical abilities, less gender specific and often 
                                depicted as dabbling in the more macabre and object-focused side of the supernatural.<sup>1</sup> Witches are often 
                                less glamorous or seductive as enchantresses, and although beautiful / dangerous witches such as 
                                <b class="n">Aradia<sup>2</sup></b> exist in the lore, their magic is not solely confined to this characterisitc, the 
                                seduction of men not their main source of power.<sup>3</sup> This also applies to its parallels with The Oracle, and 
                                although there are examples of witches who possess similar prophetic ability, they aren’t defined by this power. 
                                It is likely that those who can see the future do not possess latent supernatural ability and need to activate the 
                                ability to seek prophecy using some sort of physical or verbal conduit, such as a potion or a spell.<sup>4</sup>

                            As the practice of witchcraft was something that existed in real life (results not withstanding), many people in 
                            Christian communities feared it as they thought it was a Satanic practice, and began to harshly condemn it.<sup>5</sup> 
                            During the 14th-15th centuries in small towns and communities in colonial America and Europe, things escalated to 
                            the point that any woman who was deemed suspicious was drowned, immolated or executed if there was the slightest 
                            whisper that she may have been a witch.<sup>6</sup> The way in which they were accused and ‘tested’ for sorcery was never 
                            concrete, targeting women who may have been outcasts in some way - living alone, advanced age, different 
                            ethnicity/race outside of caucasian (see <b class="n">Tituba</b>)<sup>7</sup> - and blaming them for the town’s misfortunes 
                            that, with hindsight, can be seen were not caused by witchcraft but something more scientifically viable.<sup>8</sup> 
                            Due to these real world events, witches in western history that were shaped by the Christian narrative are generally 
                            portrayed as evil, conniving single women who sacrificed animals and children for their spells and potions.

                            A more nuanced portrayal of witches in folklore did exist before the puritanical and fear-mongering 
                            control of the narrative, and that was the depiction of witches in Celtic and Welsh mythology.<sup>9</sup> <b class="n">
                            Cerridwen</b> was a witch from Welsh folklore who was a loving mother as well as a ruthless pursuer of justice, and was the 
                            origin for the link between witches and cauldrons,<sup>10</sup> showing how originally, witches were multi-dimensional 
                            figures that became feared due to their unconventionality, religious rebellion and their representation of the fear of 
                            the unknown.

                                “In one part of the Mabinogion, which is the cycle of myths found in Welsh legend, Cerridwen brews up a potion in 
                                her magical cauldron to give to her son Afagddu (Morfran). She puts young Gwion in charge of guarding the cauldron, 
                                but three drops of the brew fall upon his finger, blessing him with the knowledge held within. Cerridwen pursues 
                                Gwion through a cycle of seasons until, in the form of a hen, she swallows Gwion, disguised as an ear of corn. 
                                Nine months later, she gives birth to Taliesen, the greatest of all the Welsh poets.” <sup>10</sup>

                                Witches have also become staples in recent pop-culture - starting from the 1970s - due to the rise and 
                                popularity of goth / punk fashion in young adult communities and the style's fascination of all things dark and macabre.<sup>4</sup> 
                                Many witch characters from movies such as <b class="n">Elvira, Mistress of The Dark<sup>5</sup></b> or <b class="n">Wednesday 
                                and Morticia Addams<sup>6</sup></b> were unapologetically goth, which appealed to some teenage / young adult girls in 
                                particular as gothic fashion became a better way they could express themselves than more societally conventional, 
                                mainstream fashion<sup>7</sup>

                            Witches in film from the early 90s also became popular in predominately queer spaces as many movies 
                            about the modern witch reflected the struggles of young, queer people at the time. Movies such as <b class="n">The Craft</b> 
                            depicted a young group of girls who were ostracised from their wider community due to their interest in witchcraft, and, 
                            like with many queer communities, found comfort and safety in their ‘coven’ (a group of friends) after their biological 
                            families rejected or misunderstood them for something they couldn’t control.<sup>8</sup> Witchcraft in recent media has 
                            therefore unwittingly become a metaphor for the queer experience, and many have found comfort in that.
