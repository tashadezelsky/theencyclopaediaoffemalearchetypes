                                <p><b class="n">The Femme Fatale</b> is the sub-archetype of The Wild Woman that embodies the centuries’ long 
                                    vilification and fear of female sexuality, especially from the patriarchal perspective, 
                                    as this trope is defined by the threat and danger she poses with her ability to seduce men, 
                                    which often leads to their doom and detriment (as they are written as helpless in the face 
                                    of it). The earliest examples of <b class="n">The Femme Fatale</b> can be found in mythical beings such as 
                                    <b class="n">sirens</b> or <b class="n">nymphs,</b> who in the form of beautiful women seduced sailors with their mystical 
                                    songs and then drowned them.<sup>1</sup> More specific examples can be found in women from the <b class="n">Bible</b>
                                    such as <b class="n">Eve</b> or <b class="n">Jezebel,</b> one tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit that in turn made 
                                    God banish them from Eden,<sup>2</sup> and the other blamed to be the cause of Israel’s apostasy due 
                                    to her ‘whorish’ ways.<sup>3</sup>

                                        With the rise of feminism and the subsequent conversations surrounding the topic as well as 
                                        its constant evolution, <b class="n">The Femme Fatale</b> as a trope has undergone significant change and 
                                        evolution in contemporary and modern media, as well as how they are viewed under a more critical 
                                        lens.<sup>1</sup>

                                        <br></br>

	                                    During the 1960s, the best place to find this sub-archetype on screen was in the James Bond 
                                        movies, Bond always running into dangerous but beautiful women who he either seduces or is 
                                        seduced by. Characters such as <b class="n">Pussy Galore</b> from the 1964 film <b class="n">Goldfinger</b> may be seen as 
                                        empowering to some - she was a rare portrayal of her gender at the time as she was a powerful 
                                        woman capable of overpowering Bond in combat, as well as being a female pilot.<sup>2</sup> However she 
                                        is also just the start of the pattern that all Bond Girls are defined by - being the dangerous, 
                                        ‘untameable’ woman that James Bond conquers by the end of the film by sleeping with them.<sup>3</sup> 
                                        In this instance, <b class="n">The Femme Fatale,</b> no matter how strong they seem to be, are still seen as 
                                        the sexy dangerous object that ironically can only be ‘beaten’ through sex (specifically sex 
                                        with a man), meaning as a whole, their identities are defined as embodying and conquering the 
                                        straight man’s object of desire.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                    
                            <div class="bodytxtblue2">

                                    Of course, there is the other side to both stories - <b class="n">Eve</b> herself was tempted by the snake to eat the 
                                    apple, and, depending on the audience, <b class="n">Jezebel</b> could be seen as a faithful and devout follower to 
                                    her pagan god Baal and that she is only seen as degenerate from a one specific religious perspective.<sup>4</sup>
                                    Despite this, both women have become best known for their part in the downfall of men over other factors, 
                                    and writers have prescribed their seduction as the main cause. <b class="n">Jezebel</b> in particular is significant as 
                                    there was no actual evidence that she was, in fact, the unfaithful whore that the writers described her as, 
                                    however she was branded this way (and has become intrinsically connected to the description) because how 
                                    else could they justify her husband committing such sins if her sexuality was not the cause of them? 
                                    (or at least frame him as more sympathetic). By making her a prostitute, she became a scapegoat, as none of the blame 
                                    falls on her husband - he was just the victim of her seduction.

                                        Samaria, the lecherous wife of a pouting potentate. The 1938 film Jezebel, starring Bette Davis as the 
                                        destructive temptress who leads a man to his death, is evidence that this ancient judgment against 
                                        Jezebel has been transmitted to this century. Nevertheless, the Bible never offers evidence that 
                                        Jezebel is unfaithful to her husband while he is alive or loose in her morals after his death.

                                        these dangerous and powerful female characters are always extremely hyper-sexualised, the main 
                                        attraction of the female superhero being her body in skin tight suits that work to highlight 
                                        every curve with their bodies contorted into physically improbable positions, rather than her 
                                        actual superpower/skill sets.<sup>4</sup> Illustrations of <b class="n">Catwoman (Selina Kyle)</b> from DC comics emphasise

                                <p>Female monsters in modern / contemporary literature and media have undergone several explorations

                                    supernatural beings, or used as metaphoric devices in horror films that 
                                    symbolise women’s plights such as female coming of age and the horrors of puberty.

                                    The 1936 film The <b class="n">Bride of Frankenstein</b> for example showcases, through body horror and 
                                    religious imagery, the pressure women felt in 20th century America to maintain an 
                                    ideal standard of female beauty, and furthermore the pressure men felt to obtain this beauty
                                    through marriage/sex/etc.<sup>1</sup> Through the construction of Frankenstein’s Monster’s ‘mate’

                                    without her consent, and how even a ‘monster’ built similarly to Frankenstein’s Monster 
                                    still looks at him in horror - shows the detrimental effects pursuing the ideal standard 
                                    of beauty can be to both genders, manifested in body horror and low self-esteem in both sexes.<sup>2</sup>

                                Movies that have gone on to become cult-classics such as 1976’s <b class="n">Carrie<sip>3</sip></b> 
                                (an adaptation of the Stephen King novel) and <b class="n">Ginger Snaps<sup>4</sup></b> in 2000 are films 
                                that use the female monster as a metaphoric device to illustrate the horrors of female puberty and 
                                coming of age. There have been many debates surrounding <b class="n">Carrie</b> and whether it perpetuates
                                a harmful message of women's puberty under a feminist lens, as the message seems to be that women 
                                turn monstrous after they menstruate for the first time (seen by <b class="n">Carrie</b> unlocking her telekinetic 
                                powers after getting her first period).<sup>5</sup> However, the underlying message that 
                                coming-of-age as a woman is a painful, embarrassing and even horrific process<sup>6</sup> is accurately 
                                portrayed despite its potentially negative perspective relating to menstruation.

                                <br></br>

                                <b class="n">Ginger Snaps</b> is another film that explores the female coming-of-age experience, but through one 
                                high school girl outcast transforming into a werewolf while her sister watches and fails to get 
                                her under control.<sup>7</sup> <b class="n">Ginger Fitzgerald’s</b> transformation into a wolf is particularly emphasised 
                                in the movie, filmed as something slow and painful, reflecting the teenage experience of going 
                                through puberty - sluggish, awkward and arduous<sup>8</sup> - through this type of body horror.

                                female form to orchestrate their own demise. This is reflected in the aforementioned 
                                examples in Greek myth,<sup>6</sup> but also in tales from Asia, Africa and South America.

                                China, Korea and Japan. Going by <b class="n">Daji,<sup>7</sup> Gumiho<sup>8</sup></b> and

                                    male-dominated activities centred around the physical (warfare, sports, etc),<sup>1</sup> a woman that 
                                    presents herself in a more stereotypically masculine way or a woman who tends to have what is 
                                    considered to be more traditionally masculine personality traits (louder, more assertive, even 
                                    vulgar)<sup>2</sup> in their respective cultures.

                                        people like how they are ‘not-like-other-girls,’ the trope has been criticised  for 
                                        perpetuating misogynistic thinking,<sup>1</sup> as it implies that women who are traditionally feminine 
                                        and enjoy feminine things are to be viewed with scorn, especially by women who wish to embody 
                                        the trope in real life.<sup>2</sup>

                                        This thinking is best seen in <b class="n">Amy Dunne</b> in the 2014 film <b class="n">Gone Girl. Amy</b>
                                        is the self described ‘cool’ girl who is not like the ‘typical’ girlfriend / wife: she is laid-back, 
                                        low maintenance, likes to drink beer and is ‘one of the boys.’ This personality however is in fact entirely 
                                        fake and she has kept up the charade from when she first met her husband so she could be 
                                        viewed as this ideal fantasy he has of her. When <b class="n">Amy</b> finds out that her husband has cheated 
                                        on her, she feels enraged as she had essentially created a whole new personality for him 
                                        by suppressing her original one, which leads her to staging her own kidnapping and even 
                                        committing some murders to teach him a lesson.<sup>3</sup> This movie explores how the traditionally 
                                        feminine have become unpopular and unliked in society, and how some women feel the 
                                        need / or pressure to embrace more masculine sides traits for all the wrong reasons- to appeal 
                                        to men or to generally be seen as ‘better,’ than other girls.<sup>4</sup>

                                        Because of her propensity to flirt with the masculine in her own self-expression in historical 
                                        times, <b class="n">The Tomboy</b> is a sub-archetype that has definitely had more freedom 
                                        to express queerness, gender non-conformity and gendered self-expression. For example, 
                                        one of <b class="n">Artemis’s</b> followers, <b class="n">Callisto,</b> was devout, following 
                                        in her footsteps in reflecting the characteristics of <b class="n">The Tomboy</b> trope. 
                                        However, another significant aspect of her story is that she sleeps with Zeus, who 
                                        only managed to do so as he disguised himself as <b class="n">Artemis</b> and seduced 
                                        <b class="n">Callisto</b> in her form.<sup>5</sup> Although Zeus slept with <b class="n">Callisto</b> 
                                        under coercion and manipulation, what is important to focus on is the willingness and desire 
                                        <b class="n">Callisto</b> had to sleep with <b class="n">Artemis,</b> 
                                        a female goddess. It would be inaccurate to take the message that women who sleep with women 
                                        all lean on the side of masculine, that because (straight) men desire women, women who are 
                                        inclined the same way then have to emulate that. The message here is more so that in 
                                        archaic times there was a small fraction of women who disrupted rigid gender constructs, 
                                        opening up for queer representations (no matter how misconstrued) in folkloric and religious

                                        embrace their more masculine sides without it being rooted by the patriarchal influence - 
                                        these characters chose to express themselves in this way as they genuinely are considered to

                                        themselves in this way for their own validation and peace of mind. Masculinity and femininity are not fighting

                                    Outside of the west, female warriors were similarly revered and feared. In the 1840s, the 
                                    West African kingdom of Dahomey had an all-female army of 6000 women so fierce that enemies 
                                    spoke of its “prodigious bravery,” known as the <b class="n"></b>Agojie,</b> who raided villages, took captives 
                                    and slashed off heads to return to their king as trophies of war.<sup>4</sup> In Japan, female samurai 
                                    called the <b class="n">Onna-Bugeisha</b> fought alongside men during the feudal era, when different samurai 
                                    lords were constantly fighting over land and territory. <b class="n">Kawahara Asako</b> for example was a 
                                    woman who fought in the Battle of Aizu that took place during the Boshin War between 
                                    1863-1869. She died defending her home against the enemy by joining the men in battle, 
                                    and she even killed her mother-in-law and daughter beforehand so that they wouldn’t suffer 
                                    a worse fate if captured by the enemy.<sup>5</sup>

                                    Female warriors are therefore revered and respected all throughout the world, cutting powerful 
                                    and rebellious figures as they fought and bested men who were considered physically stronger 
                                    than them, as well as better trained in the art of warfare.<sup>6</sup>

                                    fantasy (see <b class="n">Xena, Buffy, Charlie’s Angels)<sup>4</sup></b> and they often have romantic storylines with male

                                    telling that many shows feel the need to insert a romantic subplot in a story with a female protagonist 
                                    in the first place. Perhaps this will always be a requirement in all media set in teen / school 
                                    settings (in reference to the examples used) however it seems to take precedent in female-led
