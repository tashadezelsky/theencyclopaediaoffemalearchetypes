                                <p> The Artist as a sub-archetype of the Maiden is somewhat of an unusual one as she her

                                    The Maiden trope as many Artists are either used as a beautiful muse to

                                    damsel in distress situation. The Nine Muses in the Ancient Greek pantheon 
                                    are goddesses personified as creative practices, appearing before heroes to 
                                    inspire them in the form of a beautiful woman.<sup>1</sup> Scheherazade

                                    <p>The exploration of The Artist in modern media has diverged into many routes. 
                                        Although not confined to female characters, one framing of The Artist has 
                                        become much more focused on the character’s relationship with the artistic 
                                        skill that they possess. Many of these characters strive to be the absolute 
                                        best in their field, pushing for perfection even when they have seemingly 
                                        reached it to outside eyes. This ambition tends to alienate these characters 
                                        to others who unjustly think they are arrogant or are just intimidated by them. 
                                        This leads to isolation of the character, and they are further consumed by their 
                                        craft which quickly turns into an unhealthy obsession.
                                    <br></br>

                                    Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film Black Swan explores this idea of the obsessed artist 
                                    through a dark and grim lens. The protagonist, Nina Sayers is a ballet dancer, 
                                    and is cast to play the White and Black Swan in Tchaivosky’s Swan Lake.  
                                    She is not as confident in her portrayal as the Black Swan however, and the 
                                    limits she pushes herself to to portray the Black Swan perfectly leads her 
                                    into a descent of psychosis, and her eventual death. Her final performance 
                                    is deemed perfect by her rival (and lover) Lily, however she is not alive to 
                                    bask in her glory because her obsession had overcome her.<sup>1</sup>

                                    There are of course exceptions to The Artist characters that use their skills and 
                                    creativity outside of a male realm. The greek poet Sappho is famous for using 
                                    her skill to compose poems that express romantic and sexual desires toward both
                                    men and women, having agency over her own sexuality.<sup>3</sup> Although the gender of the 
                                    speaker is never explicitly stated in her lyric, Ode to Aphrodite, it is likely 
                                    that Sappho herself has these thoughts of yearning  toward the female goddess of 
                                    Love and Beauty, and Sappho is entranced by her beauty and struck by her desire 
                                    for her:
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="pullquotesblue">Very swift they came; and thou, gracious Vision,

                                <p>Further examples of The Artist that follow in similar vein to Sappho is Japan’s 
                                    Shinto Goddess of the Dawn, Mirth, Reverly and the Arts, Ame-no-Uzume no Mikoto. 
                                    She is known for her bravery, joviality and creativity, and according to Shinto 
                                    scripture, helped save the world from eternal darkness when she performed a 
                                    funny dance in order to coax her mistress, Goddess of the Sun Amaterasu, out of 
                                    the cave where she had secluded herself in shame.<sup>5</sup> Ame-no-Uzume, like Sappho, 
                                    is a maiden that uses her creative skills outside of a man’s relation to her, 
                                    instead using her skills in dance and song to save the whole whole world herself.</p>

                                        “Rabin defined the manic pixie dream girl as a muse whose primary role is 
                                        to teach and transform a young man. As contemporary a trope as it feels, 
                                        it’s as old as Dante with his vision of being guided through paradise by 
                                        his saintly Beatrice. Bettina was my guide, and as much as my adolescent 
                                        self thought it adored her, I thought less about her and more about how 
                                        it was she made me feel. Though I questioned whether I was good enough 
                                        for her, and I felt lucky that she’d chosen me, I didn’t question her 
                                        role as change agent in my life. It was a one-sided relationship not because 
                                        I was any more selfish than your average teen boy, but because I took it 
                                        for granted that this brilliant young woman knew the world better than I did.”<sup>2</sup>

                                        Another route of exploration The Artist has gone through in modern media 
                                        is the emergence into The Manic Pixie Dream Girl. The MPDG, simply put, 
                                        “is a type of female character often depicted as a whimsical, quirky, 
                                        sometimes eccentric, fantasy woman who saves the male protagonist from 
                                        himself. She usually aides in his transformation without ever showing 
                                        any real agency of her own.” <sup>3</sup> Significantly, they are also creatives 
                                        of some kind, to align with their quirky and different personalities. 
                                        The MPDG therefore aligns with a few histroic examples of The Artist, 
                                        such as The Nine Muses, as they are used as a tool in the form of a cool,
                                        beautiful woman to inspire or save the male protagonist from himself.

                                        There has also been a recent backlash to this trope however. Clementine 
                                        Kruczyinski in 2004’s Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind outwardly 
                                        fits this trope, however the movie actively rejects the notion that 
                                        she is a character that will ‘save’ the male hero, and further highlighting 
                                        the very real and harmful notions this trope projects onto young people 
                                        such as the romanticisation of mental illness.<sup>4</sup> It is interesting, 
                                        therefore, that The Artist has gone through many progressions, some still aligning 
                                        with how a few were viewed in the past, and others growing from the roots 
                                        of something more complex.</br></br>

                            <p>The Beauty is a sub-archetype of The Maiden that spans all cultures and highlights 
                                how much human beings universally value physical beauty, especially in women.<sup>1</sup> 
                                Almost all religions and folklore have deities and characters that personify this 
                                trait, and depending on the characters’ personalities and actions, reflect the many 
                                paradoxical ways in which female beauty is viewed. Examples that fit the typical 
                                maiden-like beauty can be seen in Psyche<sup>2</sup> or Andromeda,<sup>3</sup> who are beautiful but not 
                                dangerous as they are youthful, naive and submissive girls. Aphrodite<sup>4</sup> and Oshun,<sup>5</sup> 
                                the Greek and Yoruba Goddesses of Love and Beauty however represent the other side 
                                of the coin, wherein female beauty is seen as something dangerous, both deities 
                                possessing capricious, mercurial and sexually assertive natures, oftentimes fully 
                                aware of the power they hold and using their beauty and looks to achieve their own 
                                ends.

                                <br></br>

                                The Beauty is therefore seen, through the male gaze, as a woman of undeniable 
                                value due to her looks, and either something to be conquered or feared. 
                                Characters that fall under the first category tend to be one dimensional 
                                when making an appearance in folklore - the only quality mentioned is her 
                                beauty, and she is either in need of rescuing from some sort of evil and is 
                                only deemed worthy of rescuing precisely because she is beautiful. Her 
                                submissive nature and state of virginity further add to her allure, creating 
                                one speicific standard of female beauty and worth from her looks and lack of 
                                personality and sexual agency.<sup>6</sup>

                                <p>In a large part due to colonisation  and the consequent spread of eurocentric 
                                    beauty standards, The Beauty in mainstream, popular media in the west now 
                                    categorises their most beautiful women as women who were born with these traits.<sup>1</sup> 
                                    Furthermore, Hollywood as an institution has had a monopoly in the global entertainment 
                                    industry since the turn of the 20th century, and with the second world war exerting 
                                    America’s soft power through its culture, only further spread these standards 
                                    internationally.<sup>2</sup> Marilyn Monroe, for example, was a white-american woman with blond 
                                    hair and blue eyes (which, significantly, wasn’t her natural hair colour) and many 
                                    people believed was one of the most beautiful women in the world, her allure and what 
                                    she represented still having a major hold on society today.<sup>3</sup></p>

                                In comparison, examples that fall under the second category, of female beauty as seen 
                                as something to be feared, are figures that are fully aware of their value due to 
                                their looks, and utilise this to their own advantage. Aphrodite is a significant 
                                example, and she further highlights how society degradingly views women who utilise 
                                her beauty in this way, as she at times can be extremely jealous, mean spitrited 
                                and volatile.<sup>7</sup> It is important to note, therefore, that The Beauty is a sub-archetype 
                                is very paradoxical, reflecting the conflicting views many societies seem to have on 
                                female beauty and the power it holds, and how it seems to look down upon women who 
                                use the power society has given to her to achieve her goals.

                                    Old Hollywood of course acknowledged that people of other races were objectively beautiful 
                                    and cast them in films - Chinese actress Anna May Wong was extremely successful in her 
                                    career - however it is important to acknowledge that many people of color cast to play, 
                                    no matter how beautiful they were, were villains, who either attempted to seduce the 
                                    heroic and and noble white actor/actress,<sup>4</sup> or ‘exotic’ novelties who were far more 
                                    sexualised than their white counterparts who needed to be conquered by the white man 
                                    and ‘civilised.’ This mindset can still be seen in the popular Disney princess films 
                                    released from the late 90s, early 2000s, wherein characters like Esmerelda, Jasmine 
                                    and Pocahontas wore far more revealing clothes and were designed to be more curvaceous 
                                    than Belle, Aurora or Cinderella.<sup>5</sup>

                                    Of course, fighting against the Eurocentric beauty standard has become more prevalent - 
                                    African-American artists like Beyoncé have used their influence to inspire women 
                                    like her to have pride in their origins and stand against this harmful standard,<sup>6</sup> 
                                    and diversity in Hollywood has been put under a much more critical lens by the public, 
                                    which may be a positive sign for more heterogeneity in mainstream media.<sup>7</sup>

                                    complex is was a term coined by psychologist Sigmund Freud, wherein (usually) a man cannot 
                                    feel sexual arousal for his wife or someone who he respects and is in a loving relationship 
                                    in (The Madonna), however can feel sexual desire for a women who he views as degraded or 
                                    debased (The Whore).<sup>2</sup> This complex is obviously harmful, as it enforces the idea that women 
                                    who are not sexually assertive are ‘good’ and worthy of respect, whereas women who are the 
                                    opposite are ‘sluts’ and degraded sexual objects.<sup>3</sup>

                                    <p> The Madonna and The Whore as sub-archetypes has been a popular trope to explore in contemporary 
                                        literature, and many authors have taken to subvert it. In Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula, the 
                                        two women Lucy Westenra and Mina Murray juxtapose each other as Madonna and Whore, however the 
                                        two have elements of both. Lucy entertains three suitors, but is kind, pure-hearted and dies as 
                                        a virgin. Mina, while not exactly a whore, is empowered and provocative, and as she was a married 
                                        woman, it is safe to assume that she was not a virgin and played a significant role in defeating 
                                        Dracula.<sup>1</sup> Interestingly, in the movie adaptation in 1992, this subversion is erased, meaning there 
                                        may be a regression to biblical thinking in more current media.<sup>2</sup>

                                        As one can tell from the etymology, The Bible has had a large hand in the foundations of this 
                                        mindset, with The Madonna referring to the Virgin Mary, who is celebrated for becoming a mother 
                                        to Jesus without losing her virginity,  and The Whore referring, perhaps, to The Whore of Babylon, 
                                        who ‘tempted’ the Kings of Earth to commit adultery and bringing forth the end of the world 
                                        (it is significant to note here that the blame lies entirely on the woman, and views men as 
                                        helpless victims to their desires and not as an active participant).<sup>4</sup> Both are weighed on the 
                                        scale of morality due to their sexual status, and that is all that they are defined by.

                                        Cultures and religions from a time before the rise of Christianity likewise had their own views that 
                                        reflected The Madonna-Whore Complex, and the patriarchal dictatorship and double standard when it 
                                        comes to the state of a woman’s sexuality has been a popular of point of discussion since what seems 
                                        to be almost the beginning of time. However, some cultures had slightly more complex and nuanced

                                        interest of the popular bad boy, Steve Harrington. In the third episode, Nancy loses her virginity 
                                        to Steve, however while she and Steve sleep together, Nancy’s best friend Barb is killed by the 
                                        Demogorgon.<sup>3</sup> From Nancy losing her virginity in a room that is just upstairs from where Barb was 
                                        sitting moments before her death, an interpretation could be made that this is Nancy’s punishment 
                                        for losing her virginity and for her transition from Madonna to Whore.<sup>4</sup> Of course, the opposite 
                                        could be assumed as this subverts the stereotypical horror trope that the promiscuous girl dies 
                                        and the virgin lives.<sup>5</sup> However, it is still a visual  representation on how one girl deserves to 
                                        live over the other due to their sexual status.

                                        Martin Scorsese’s 1976 film Taxi Driver further delves into this regression, however the regression is 
                                        from the view point of Travis, the male protagonist, and the film in fact criticises the narrow minded 
                                        and delusional way he views women (as well as the rest of the world). Travis was infatuated with Betty 
                                        and saw her as a beacon of purity, however after she rejects him, he instantly changes and sees her as 
                                        “just like all the others” (whore). On the other hand, he starts off seeing Iris, a prostitute, as a 
                                        whore, however he soon becomes obsessed with becoming her white night and ‘saving’ her, largely due to 
                                        how young she is - when he dies, she appears as a fgure in white, as if she was an angel.<sup>6</sup>

                                            This moment was captured well in an episode of Sex and the City between Charlotte (played by 
                                            Kristin Davis) and Trey (played by Kyle MacLachlan). Followng their wedding, Trey is unable to 
                                            perform as he sees Charlotte as the virginal character who he wed. To switch this perception,

                                        A popular Mayan legend about The Xtabay (The Jungle Witch)  tells a story about two sisters, Xkeban 
                                        and Utz-colel. They were both beautiful, however Xkeban was far more promiscuous than the Utz-colel, 
                                        who was a virgin. One was treated badly by her community because of this and the other celebrated, 
                                        however what is different about this tale is that The Whore was kind and giving to her community 
                                        and far from evil, whereas the The Madonna was cruel, cold-hearted and thought she was superior to 
                                        everyone. When Xkeban died, she metamorphosed into a beautiful and fragrant smelling flower, and 
                                        Utz-Colel arrogantly and jealously thought she would morph into an even prettier flower. However 
                                        when her time came her dead body had an unbearable smell, and flowers disappeared around it. 
                                        Utz-colel eventually became The Xtabay, a demon, as she was so consumed in her jealousy and rage 
                                        even after death.<sup>5</sup> It is significant to see a very different moral on the Madonna-Whore archetype 
                                        from such an ancient culture, however this highlights how  rooted The Madonna-Whore complex is in 
                                        inaccurate, sexist and toxic prejudices.

                                <p>The Princess is a specific figure from folklore from all around the world - a popular sub-archetype 
                                    that captured the imaginations and minds of many from archaic cultures to the present. The Princess 
                                    is often mistaken from The Beauty - A princess cannot be a princess without being beautiful. 
                                    However what separates the two is that The Beauty can include figures that use their looks for 
                                    their own purposes, and aren’t deemed ‘virtuous.’ The Princess however is almost always sweet, kind, 
                                    morally righteous and most importantly ‘pure,’ her role in life set as a damsel in distress needing 
                                    to be saved from a knight, a prince, a king, etc.<sup>1</sup> All princess characters are furthermore not necessarily 
                                    high-born, some, like Rapunzel or Cinderella, born from normal families,<sup>2</sup> however they fall under 
                                    this category as they are, again, normally rescued by a man of noble-birth, making her a princess 
                                    through marriage.

                                    <p> The fascination with The Princess has continued through to current popculture. Disney animation 
                                        studios have released a widely popular line of movies since the 1930s, starting with Snow White, 
                                        centred around princess characters (all classified as such even if they aren’t necessarily 
                                        from noble birth). These stories are usually always romantic, the princess character paired with 
                                        a young, good-looking man who is usually a noble or a son of someone of power.<sup>1</sup> As the conversation 
                                        around 3rd-wave feminism and subsequent interest in more diverse, stronger female characters 
                                        arose<sup>2</sup> when Disney animation was at its ‘renaissance’ of animation,<sup>3</sup> Disney princesses evolved 
                                        into more empowered characters who have storylines outside of their romantic interests. Mulan 
                                        saves China with her skills and competence as a warrior, her romance with General Li-Shang a 
                                        secondary plot,<sup>4</sup> and in Pixar’s Brave, there is no romantic element at all, the movie focusing 
                                        instead on a tom-boy princess, Meredith, and her strained relationship with her mother.<sup>5</sup></p>

                                    From looking at The Princess archetype in many archaic folktales,  the common message that ideally,
                                    women were not beings of agency and they should simply sit around waiting to be rescued by a handsome 
                                    prince, who will whisk them off to a better life. This theme reflects and give a glimpse to how women 
                                    were treated in a few patriarchal societies and why they were displayed this way in folklore 
                                    predominantly native to the west.<sup>4</sup>

                                    There were certainly exceptions to this rule - not all cultures championed this mindset, and certain communities like the Mossi 
                                    people in Burkina Faso celebrated their Princess Yennenga for being a warrior and a fighter.<sup>5</sup> However much of western mainstream 
                                    pop-culture have only begun to view ‘strong’ female characters as a figure of interest, and have followed the mould of the 
                                    Princess as a damsel in distress figure until possibly the turn of the 20th and 21st century.

                            <p>The correlation between women and sadness is at first glance may be a surprising one, but it has existed 
                                since the archaic times. Many deities that personified depression, sadness and melancholia from global 
                                cultures have been women, the Roman Goddess Miseria (born from her Grecian counterpart Oziys) even 
                                contributing to the etymology of the word we know as ‘misery.’<sup>1</sup> There is no straight answer as to why 
                                there is such a link between women and sadness - is it perhaps how women, unlike men, had the ability 
                                to feel their depression without as much societal shame,<sup>2</sup> therefore cementing in people’s minds that 
                                sadness was more of a feminine trait? The exact reasoning is unknown, however it is significant to see 
                                that women and melancholia have been inextricably tied together in all corners of the world.

                                <p>The allure of The Sad Girl has only heightened in media after Ophelia set the precedent in Hamlet. The 
                                    romanticisation of a beautiful, skinny and almost always white girl and her depression/mental 
                                    turmoil has become a common theme to see in many films, evolving beyond seeing her as just an aesthetic 
                                    dead victim, but a target of romantic desire of a male protagonist, where male ‘heroes’ are consumed 
                                    with the desire to save her, sometimes from herself or a terminal illness of some kind. The first 
                                    example can be seen in Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo, where Scottie, a detective, becomes obsessed with 
                                    a woman he is hired to follow, Madeline, after she commits suicide by falling to her death. He dresses 
                                    another woman as her,  and is consumed with thoughts on how he could have saved her, the root of her 
                                    sadness, and his ‘love’ for her.<sup>1</sup>

                                Evolving from religious spaces, sad women (or girls), became a figure of interest in early literature. 
                                Hamlet’s Ophelia is the original Sad Girl, and Fabiola from Nicholas Patricks Stephen Wiseman’s 1898 novel 
                                of the same name explores in further depth how a girl who seems to have everything - wealth, beauty, etc - 
                                could still feel so sad and unsatisfied.<sup>3</sup>

                                <br></br>
	                            
                                Furthermore, Ophelia’s example set another precedent for Sad Girls in literature and works of media going 
                                forward, which is the aestheticization and romanticisation of female misery. In Hamlet, her suicide is 
                                romanticised, even idealised,<sup>4</sup> and this theme carries through to visual representations of her in various 
                                works of art - In John Everett Millais painting, she is depicting as a beautiful  maiden, deathly pale, 
                                lying in a still body of water surrounded by flowers with her hair fanned out around her. She does not 
                                look like a corpse - instead, she is a romantic, dreamy figure, a beautiful tragedy.<sup>5</sup> This fascination 
                                with female sadness, even madness and tragedy,  is something that has only grown in pop-culture, and 
                                perhaps, at least during Ophelia’s time, reflects the hypothesis that only women were prone to such 
                                ‘hysteria’ (or what we know now as mental illness)6 and if they happen to be beautiful, thin and white, 
                                they are seen as romantic tragedies worth mourning and morbid fascination, and perhaps as a cautionary tale.

                                    The Virgin Suicides, directed by Sofia Coppola in 1999, also sees a male characters look back on an 
                                    unattainable yet tragic group of sisters they knew as teenagers who committed suicide in their 
                                    adolescence due to their zealously religious parents’ abuse and overbearing behaviour.<sup>2</sup> These sisters 
                                    are conventionally attractive and happen to be virgins, thus acting as tragically beautiful and 
                                    dreamy enigmas to the men who reminisce about them, Coppola’s trademark pastel colours and fantastical 
                                    cinematography<sup>3</sup> highlighting the romanticised way in which the men see the girls.

                                    The Sad Girl who is ridden with a terminal illness who becomes the doomed romantic interest of the male 
                                    protagonist is a popular character in a many Japanese anime shows and movies.  Your Lie In April<sup>4</sup> 
                                    and the movie I Want To Eat Your Pancreas<sup>5</sup> tell the story of high school boys who fall in love with a girl 
                                    who tragically die at the end of the story, and like with The Manic Pixie Dream Girl, these girls are both 
                                    vibrant and full of life, bringing excitement and ‘saving’ the male protagonist in a spiritual sense, 
                                    however because they die, they become a tragic footnote in the men’s story that is sadly yet fondly 
                                    remembered. The girls’ tragedies is not about them in these stories - instead, it is about the men, and 
                                    how their deaths helped these men grow as people.

                                The Selfish Girl is a sub-archetype that is split between two different types  of personalities - one 
                                defined as a maiden that is intentionally mean spirited and self-serving, and the other not outwardly so, 
                                however her careless and - sometimes- selfish actions have drastic consequences  on the people and greater 
                                communities around her. The second example can be seen in infamous figures from Greek myth - Pandora and 
                                her curiosity unleashed horrors from the box,<sup>1</sup> and Helen of Troy ignited the Trojan War when she ran off 
                                with Paris.<sup>2</sup> Of course, these two women weren’t entirely at fault, Helen least of all as it is widely 
                                debated that Paris abducted her against her will,<sup>3</sup> however these women are solely remembered as the cause, 
                                their actions alone triggering catastrophic events even if they were tested or taken against their will, 
                                and none of the other instigators are blamed.

                                    The other personality of The Selfish Girl shows a maiden who is usually beautiful, yet, like some characters who 
                                    fall under The Beauty sub-archetype, tend to use their beauty to achieve their own ends. Furthermore, they are 
                                    actively mean-spirited and antagonistic, and their beauty acts as a contrast to who they are inside - a rose 
                                    with thorns.

                                    An obvious example from folklore are Cinderella’s wicked step-sisters, who abuse Cinderella, degrading her and 
                                    forcing her to do brutal chores.<sup>4</sup> Aphrodite, again, can also fall under this archetype, as she is easily quick 
                                    to anger, jealous of other women who offer her what she deems as competition in physical looks, and wishes them 
                                    harm because of it. She sends her son, Cupid, to harm Psyche when people start to worship her, deserting 
                                    Aphrodite’s temple.<sup>5</sup> This element of competition over physical beauty is a significant characteristic when 
                                    looking at The Selfish Girl in historical context, and one that has carried over to mainstream pop-culture in 
                                    modern and contemporary literature and media.

                                The Selfish Girl in the 21st century is know more commonly known as The Mean Girl - the foundations of their 
                                earlier counterparts are there, however they have evolved in accordance to the setting they find themselves 
                                placed, which is a middle/high school, or even college.The introduction of films revolving around teen settings, 
                                such as teen romantic comedies (or rom-coms) or teen dramas have made The Mean Girl a staple, perhaps the most 
                                well-known example of the original Mean Girl being Heather Chandler in the 1980 film Heathers.<sup>5</sup> The Mean Girl is 
                                almost always rich, promiscuous, beautiful and aware of it - using her looks and wealth to rise up in the social 
                                ladder at school - and extremely popular. Regina George in the 2009 movie Mean Girls embodies this, as she is 
                                nasty to everyone, but people ‘still want to be her,’<sup>6</sup> showcasing how The Mean Girl reflects the absurdity of 
                                peer pressure that can be found in school enviroments as well as the value we as a society place on physical 
                                beauty (as it may let immoral people get away with immoral behaviour). Nevertheless, The Mean Girl is also usually 
                                multi-dimensional, showing how the perpetrators themselves are to some extent also a victim of circumstance - at 
                                the end of the day, they are just playing the ‘game’ (see Claire Standish from The Breakfast Club)<sup>7</sup>

                                One of the most notorious examples of The Selfish Girl that came out of contemporary times and 
                                simultaneously changed the way women were portrayed in media is Scarlett O’Hara from the 1936 novel 
                                (and later the movie adaptation) Gone With The Wind. Scarlett is a southern belle who struggles with 
                                acting as she is expected to - prettily and refined. Her determination to get what she wants paired 
                                with her intelligence dominates, and reveals selfish and potentially narcissistic parts of her 
                                personality. She is therefore far from perfect, easily manipulating the people around her and even 
                                killing a man to achieve her goals and is blinded and stubborn by what she thinks is right, which, 
                                coupled with her selfishness, causes her to lose her love interest, Rhett Butler.<sup>1</sup> Scarlett as a 
                                female protagonist is thus complex and flawed, which was highly unusual at the time, and perhaps 
                                set the precedent of imperfect (and even unlikable) female characters which fall under The Selfish 
                                Girl in pop-culture today.<sup>2</sup>

                                “The Mean Girl’s dominance over other girls, the subterfuge, and psychological evisceration she performed to uphold her 
                                dominance, became a hyper-ostentatious parody of womanhood itself — to exist as a woman was to constantly compare 
                                against and compete with other women. The Mean Girl trope had us all believe that the dark side to womanhood is catty, 
                                conniving competitiveness.” <sup>4</sup>
