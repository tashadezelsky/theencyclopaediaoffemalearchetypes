                                    <p>The exploration of <b class="n">The Artist</b> in modern media has diverged into many routes. 
                                        Although not confined to female characters, one framing of <b class="n">The Artist</b> has 
                                        become much more focused on the character’s relationship with the artistic 
                                        skill that they possess. Many of these characters strive to be the absolute 
                                        best in their field, pushing for perfection even when they have
                                        reached it to outside eyes. This ambition tends to alienate these characters 
                                        to others who unjustly think they are arrogant or are intimidated by them. 
                                        This leads to isolation of the character, and they are further consumed by their 
                                        craft which quickly turns into an unhealthy obsession.
                                    <br></br>

                                    Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film <b class="n">Black Swan</b> explores this idea of the obsessed artist 
                                    through a dark and grim lens. The protagonist, <b class="n">Nina Sayers</b> is a ballet dancer, 
                                    and is cast to play the White and Black Swan in Tchaivosky’s Swan Lake.  
                                    She is not as confident in her portrayal as the Black Swan however, and the 
                                    limits she pushes herself to to portray the Black Swan leads her 
                                    into a descent of psychosis, and her eventual death. Her final performance 
                                    is deemed perfect by her rival (and imagined lover) <b class="n">Lily,</b> however she is not alive to 
                                    bask in her glory because her obsession had overcome her.<sup>1</sup>

                                    There are of course exceptions to<b class="n"> The Artist</b> characters that use their skills and 
                                    creativity outside of a male realm. The greek poet <b class="n">Sappho</b> is famous for using 
                                    her skill to compose poems that express romantic and sexual desires toward both
                                    men and women, having agency over her own sexuality.<sup>3</sup> Although the gender of the 
                                    speaker is never explicitly stated in her lyric, <b class="n">Ode to Aphrodite,</b> it is likely 
                                    that <b class="n">Sappho</b> herself has these thoughts of yearning toward the female Goddess of 
                                    Love and Beauty, and <b class="n">Sappho</b> is entranced by her beauty and struck by her desire 
                                    for her:

                                        “Rabin defined the manic pixie dream girl as a muse whose primary role is 
                                        to teach and transform a young man. As contemporary a trope as it feels,

                                        his saintly Beatrice. Bettina was my guide, and as much as my adolescent 
                                        self thought it adored her, I thought less about her and more about how 
                                        it was she made me feel. Though I questioned whether I was good enough 
                                        for her, and I felt lucky that she’d chosen me, I didn’t question her 
                                        role as change agent in my life. It was a one-sided relationship not because 
                                        I was any more selfish than your average teen boy, but because I took it 
                                        for granted that this brilliant young woman knew the world better than I did.”<sup>2</sup>

                                        of some kind, to align with their quirky and different personalities. 
                                        The MPDG aligns with a few histroic examples of <b class="n">The Artist,</b>
                                        such as <b class="n">The Nine Muses,</b> as they are used as a tool in the form of an unusual,
                                        beautiful woman to inspire or save the male protagonist from himself. 
                                <!----> <br><br> 
                                        There has been a recent backlash to this trope however. <b class="n">Clementine 
                                        Kruczyinski</b> in 2004’s <b class="n">Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind</b> outwardly 
                                        fits this trope, however the movie actively rejects the notion that 
                                        she is a character that will ‘save’ the male hero, and further highlighting 
                                        the very real and harmful notions this trope projects onto young women, 
                                        such as the romanticisation of mental illness.<sup>4</sup> It is interesting, 
                                        therefore, that <b class="n">The Artist</b> has gone through many progressions, some still aligning 
                                        with how they were viewed in the past, and others growing from these roots 
                                        into something more complex.</br></br>

                            <p><b class="n">The Beauty</b> is a sub-archetype of The Maiden that spans all cultures and highlights 
                                the extent of how humans universally value physical beauty, especially in women.<sup>1</sup> 
                                Almost all religions and folklore have deities and characters that personify this 
                                trait, and depending on the characters’ personalities and actions, reflect the many 
                                paradoxical ways in which female beauty is viewed. Examples that fit the typical 
                                maiden-like beauty can be seen in <b class="n">Psyche<sup>2</sup></b> or <b class="n">Andromeda,<sup>3</sup></b> 
                                who are beautiful but not dangerous as they are youthful, naive and submissive girls. 
                                <b class="n">Aphrodite<sup>4</sup></b> and <b class="n">Oshun,<sup>5</sup></b> 
                                the Greek and Yoruba Goddesses of Love and Beauty however represent the other side 
                                of the coin, wherein female beauty is seen as something dangerous, both deities 
                                possessing capricious, mercurial and sexually assertive natures, fully 
                                aware of the power they hold and using their beauty and looks to achieve their own 
                                ends.

                                <br></br>

                                <b class="n">The Beauty</b> is therefore seen, through the male gaze, as a woman of undeniable 
                                value due to her looks, and either something to be conquered or feared. 
                                Characters that fall under the first category tend to be one dimensional 
                                in folklore - the only quality mentioned is her 
                                beauty, and she is either in need of rescuing from some sort of evil and is 
                                only deemed worthy of rescuing precisely because she is beautiful. Her 
                                submissive nature and state of virginity further add to her allure, creating 
                                one speicific standard of female beauty and worth from her looks and lack of 
                                personality and sexual agency.<sup>6</sup>

                                    categorises their most beautiful women as women who were born with these traits.<sup>1</sup> 
                                    Furthermore, Hollywood as an institution has had a monopoly in the global entertainment 
                                    industry since the turn of the 20th century, and with the second world war exerting 
                                    America’s soft power through its culture, only further spread these standards 
                                    internationally.<sup>2</sup> <b class="n">Marilyn Monroe,</b> for example, was a white-american woman with blonde

                                    people believed she was one of the most beautiful women in the world, her allure and what 
                                    she represented still having a major hold on society today.<sup>3</sup></p>

                                In comparison, examples that fall under the second category, of female beauty as something to be feared, 
                                are figures that are fully aware of their value due to 
                                their looks, and utilise this to their own advantage. <b class="n">Aphrodite</b> is a significant 
                                example, and she further highlights how society degradingly views women who utilise 
                                her beauty in this way, as she at times can be extremely jealous, mean spitrited 
                                and volatile.<sup>7</sup> It is important to note that <b class="n">The Beauty</b> is very paradoxical, 
                                reflecting the conflicting views many societies seem to have on 
                                female beauty and the power it holds, and how it seems to look down upon women who 
                                use the power society has given them to achieve their goals.

                                    Old Hollywood did acknowledge that people of other races were objectively beautiful 
                                    and cast them in films - Chinese actress <b class="n">Anna May Wong</b> had an extremely successful 
                                    career - however it is important to note that many people of color were cast to play villains 
                                    no matter how beautiful they were, who either attempted to seduce the 
                                    heroic and and noble white actor / actress,<sup>4</sup> or ‘exotic’ novelties who were far more 
                                    sexualised than their white counterparts who needed to be conquered by the white man 
                                    and ‘civilised.’ This mindset can still be seen in the popular Disney princess films 
                                    released in the late 90s / early 2000s, wherein characters like <b class="n">Esmerelda, Jasmine</b>

                                    Of course, fighting against the Eurocentric beauty standard has become more prevalent - 
                                    African-American artists like <b class="n">Beyoncé</b> have used their influence to inspire women 
                                    who look like her to have pride in their origins and stand against this harmful standard,<sup>6</sup> 
                                    and diversity in Hollywood has been put under a much more critical lens by the public, 
                                    which may be a positive sign for more heterogeneity in mainstream media.<sup>7</sup>

                                    complex</b> was a term coined by psychologist Sigmund Freud, wherein (usually) a man cannot 
                                    feel sexual arousal for his wife or someone who he respects and is in a loving relationship 
                                    with (The Madonna), however can feel sexual desire for a woman who he views as degraded or 
                                    debased (The Whore).<sup>2</sup> This complex is obviously harmful, as it enforces the idea that women 
                                    are simply seen as degraded sexual objects and sexually desirable by a man until the man gets to know
                                    them personally and realise they are a human-being worthy of respect, which consequently makes them sexually 
                                    undesirable.<sup>3</sup>

                                        literature, and many authors have taken to subverting it. In Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel <b class="n">Dracula,</b> the 
                                        two women <b class="n">Lucy Westenra</b> and <b class="n">Mina Murray</b> juxtapose each other as <b class="n">Madonna</b> 
                                        and <b class="n">Whore,</b> however the two have elements of both. <b class="n">Lucy</b> entertains three suitors, but is 
                                        kind, pure-hearted and dies as a virgin. <b class="n">Mina,</b> while not exactly a whore, is empowered and provocative, 
                                        and as she was a married woman, she was not a virgin and played a significant role in defeating  <b class="n">Dracula.<sup>1</sup></b> 
                                        Interestingly, in the movie adaptation in 1992, this subversion is erased, <b class="n">Lucy</b> acting as Whore and <b class="n">Mina</b> as Madonna, 
                                        meaning there may be a regression toward the biblical thinking in more recent media.<sup>2</sup>

                                        for becoming a mother to Jesus without losing her virginity, and <b class="n">The Whore</b> referring, perhaps, 
                                        to <b class="n">Mary Magdalene</b> or <b class="n">The Whore of Babylon,</b> who ‘tempted’ the Kings of Earth 
                                        with her sexuality to commit adultery and bring forth the end of the world. It is significant to note that in this
                                        tale the blame lies entirely on the woman, and the men are viewed as helpless victims to their desires and not 
                                        as an active participant.<sup>4</sup> Both are weighed on the scale of morality due to their sexual status, and

                                        This regression to the biblical ideations of <b class="n">The Madonna & The Whore</b> in 20th/21st century mainstream 
                                        media can be seen in the Netflix series <b class="n">Stranger Things,</b> released in 2016. In the first season, one of 
                                        the protagonists, <b class="n">Nancy Wheeler,</b> is introduced as a sweet, pure, bookish girl who has caught the 
                                        interest of the popular bad boy, Steve Harrington. In the third episode, <b class="n">Nancy</b> loses her virginity 
                                        to Steve, however while she and Steve sleep together, <b class="n">Nancy’s</b> best friend <b class="n">Barb</b> is killed by the 
                                        Demogorgon.<sup>3</sup> From <b class="n">Nancy</b> losing her virginity in a room that is just upstairs from where <b class="n">Barb</b> 
                                        was sitting moments before her death, an interpretation could be made that this is <b class="n">Nancy’s</b> punishment 
                                        for losing her virginity and for her transition from <b class="n">Madonna to Whore.<sup>4</sup></b> Of course, the opposite 
                                        could be assumed as this subverts the stereotypical horror trope that the promiscuous girl dies 
                                        and the virgin lives.<sup>5</sup> However, it is still a visual representation of the belief that one girl deserves to 
                                        live over the other due to their sexual status.

                                        Martin Scorsese’s 1976 film <b class="n">Taxi Driver</b> further delves into this regression, however the regression is 
                                        from the view point of Travis, the male protagonist, and the film criticises the narrow minded 
                                        and delusional way he (as well as the rest of the world) views women as Madonna and Whore. Travis was infatuated with 
                                        <b class="n">Betty</b> and saw her as a beacon of purity (madonnna), however after she rejects him, he instantly changes his mind 
                                        and sees her as “just like all the others” (whore). On the other hand, he starts off seeing <b class="n">Iris,</b> 
                                        a child prostitute, as whore, however he soon becomes obsessed with becoming her white night and ‘saving’ her, largely 
                                        due to how young she is - and when he dies, she appears to him as a figure in white, as if she was an angel.<sup>6</sup>

                                            wish to — and sometimes can’t — ‘degrade’ her by having sex, leading to frustration and anger on both

                                            This moment was captured well in an episode of Sex and the City between Charlotte (played by 
                                            Kristin Davis) and Trey (played by Kyle MacLachlan). Followng their wedding, Trey is unable to 
                                            perform as he sees Charlotte as the virginal character who he wed. To switch this perception, 
                                            Charlotte plays with herself in front of him to show she is, in fact, a woman with desires.” <sup>7</sup>

                                        A popular Mayan legend about <b class="n">The Xtabay (The Jungle Witch)</b> tells a story about two sisters, 
                                        <b class="n">Xkeban</b> and <b class="n">Utz-colel.</b> They were both beautiful, however <b class="n">Xkeban</b> 
                                        was far more promiscuous than <b class="n">Utz-colel,</b> who was a virgin. One was treated badly by her community 
                                        because of this and the other celebrated, however what is different about this tale is that <b class="n">The Whore</b> 
                                        was kind and giving to her community, whereas the <b class="n">The Madonna</b> was cruel, cold-hearted and thought 
                                        she was superior to everyone. When <b class="n">Xkeban</b> died, to the surprise of everyone she metamorphosed into 
                                        a beautiful and fragrant smelling flower, and <b class="n">Utz-Colel</b> arrogantly and jealously thought she would 
                                        morph into an even prettier flower when her time came. However when her time came her dead body had an unbearable smell, 
                                        and flowers disappeared around it. <b class="n">Utz-colel</b> eventually became The Xtabay, a demon, as she was so 
                                        consumed in her jealousy and rage toward her sister even after death.<sup>5</sup> It is significant to see a very 
                                        different moral take on the <b class="n">Madonna-Whore</b> archetype from such an ancient culture, however this 
                                        highlights how the current understanding of <b class="n">The Madonna-Whore complex</b> is rooted in inaccurate, sexist 
                                        and toxic prejudices.

                                <p><b class="n">The Princess</b> is a specific figure from folklore from all around the world - a popular sub-archetype 
                                    that captured the imaginations and minds of many from archaic and present societies. <b class="n">The Princess</b> 
                                    is often mistaken for The Beauty - A princess cannot be a princess without being beautiful. 
                                    However what separates the two is that The Beauty can include figures that use their looks for 
                                    their own purposes, and aren’t deemed ‘virtuous.’ <b class="n">The Princess</b> however is almost always sweet, kind, 
                                    morally righteous and most importantly ‘pure,’ her role in life set as a damsel in distress needing 
                                    to be saved from a knight, a prince, a king, etc.<sup>1</sup> All princess characters are furthermore not necessarily 
                                    high-born, some, like <b class="n">Rapunzel</b> or <b class="n">Cinderella,</b> born from normal families,<sup>2</sup> 
                                    however they fall under this category as they are, again, normally rescued by a man of noble-birth, making her a

                                        centred around princess characters. These stories are usually always romantic, the princess character paired with 
                                        a young, good-looking man who is usually a noble or a son of someone of fiscal power.<sup>1</sup> As the conversation

                                        arose<sup>2</sup> and when Disney animation was at its ‘renaissance,’<sup>3</sup> Disney princesses evolved

                                    From looking at <b class="n">The Princess</b> archetype in many folktales, the common message is that that ideally,
                                    women were not to be beings of agency and they should simply sit around waiting to be rescued by a handsome 
                                    prince, who will whisk them off to a better life. This theme reflects and gives a glimpse into how women 
                                    were treated in patriarchal societies and why they were displayed in this way in folklore 
                                    predominantly native to the west.<sup>4</sup>

                                    There were certainly exceptions to this rule - not all cultures championed this mindset, and certain communities 
                                    like the Mossi people in Burkina Faso celebrated their <b class="n">Princess Yennenga</b> for being a warrior and a 
                                    fighter.<sup>5</sup> However much of western mainstream pop-culture have only begun to view ‘strong’ female 
                                    characters as a figure of interest, and have followed the mould of <b class="n">The 
                                    Princess</b> as a damsel in distress figure until the turn of the 20th and 21st century.

                            <p>The correlation between women and sadness may be a surprising one at first glance, but it has existed 
                                since the archaic times. Many deities that personified depression, sadness and melancholia from all 
                                religions have been women, the Roman <b class="n">Goddess Miseria</b> (born from her Grecian counterpart Oziys) 
                                the foundation to the etymology of the word ‘misery.’<sup>1</sup> There is no straight answer as to why 
                                there is such a link between women and sadness - is it perhaps how women, unlike men, had the ability 
                                to feel their depression with less societal shame,<sup>2</sup> therefore cementing in people’s minds that 
                                sadness was more of a feminine trait? The exact reasoning is unknown, however it is significant to see 
                                that women and melancholia have been inextricably tied together in all corners of the world.

                                    and her depression / mental turmoil has become a common theme to see in many films, evolving beyond seeing her

                                    are consumed with the desire to save her, sometimes from herself, terminal illness, or some other tragedy. The first 
                                    example can be seen in Alfred Hitchcock’s <b class="n">Vertigo,</b> wherein Scottie, a detective, becomes obsessed

                                Furthermore, <b class="n">Ophelia’s</b> set another precedent for Sad Girls in literature and works of media, 
                                which is the aestheticization and romanticisation of female misery. In <b class="n">Hamlet,</b> her suicide is 
                                romanticised, even idealised,<sup>4</sup> and this theme carries through to visual representations of her in various 
                                works of art. In John Everett Millais painting, she is depicted as a beautiful maiden, deathly pale, 
                                lying in a still body of water surrounded by flowers with her hair fanned out around her. She does not 
                                look like a corpse - instead, she is a romantic, dreamy figure, a beautiful tragedy.<sup>5</sup> This fascination 
                                with female sadness, madness and tragedy, is something that has only grown in pop-culture, and 
                                perhaps, at least during <b class="n">Ophelia’s</b> time, reflects the belief that only women were prone to such 
                                fits of ''irrational' misery ot ‘hysteria’ (what we know now as mental illness)<sup>6</sup> and if they happen 
                                to be beautiful, thin and white, they are seen as romantic tragedies worth mourning and be morbidly fascinated by.

                                <b class="n">The Selfish Girl</b> is a sub-archetype that is split between two different types of personalities - one 
                                defined as a maiden that is intentionally mean spirited and self-serving, and the other not outwardly so, 
                                however her careless and sometimes selfish actions have drastic consequences on the people and 
                                communities around her. The second example can be seen in infamous figures from Greek myth - <b class="n">Pandora</b> and 
                                her curiosity which unleashed horrors from the box,<sup>1</sup> and <b class="n">Helen of Troy</b> igniting the Trojan War 
                                when she ran off with Paris.<sup>2</sup> Of course, these two women weren’t entirely at fault, <b class="n">Helen</b> 
                                least of all as it is widely debated that Paris abducted her against her will,<sup>3</sup> however these women are 
                                solely remembered as the cause, their actions alone triggering catastrophic events even if they were tested or taken 
                                against their will, and none of the other (male) instigators are blamed.

                                    some characters who fall under The Beauty sub-archetype, tend to use their beauty to achieve their own ends. 
                                    Furthermore, they are intentionally mean-spirited and antagonistic, and their beauty / personalities acts as a 
                                    reflection to who they are inside - a rose with thorns.

                                    An obvious example from folklore are <b class="n">Cinderella’s wicked step-sisters,</b> who abuse <b class="n">Cinderella,</b> 
                                    degrading her and forcing her to do brutal chores.<sup>4</sup> <b class="n">Aphrodite,</b> again, also falls under this 
                                    archetype, as she is easily quick to anger, jealous of other women who she deems as competition in physical looks, and 
                                    wishes them harm because of it. She sends her son, Cupid, to harm <b class="n">Psyche</b> when people start to worship her 
                                    in favor of the goddess, deserting <b class="n">Aphrodite’s</b> temple.<sup>5</sup> This element of competition over 
                                    physical beauty is a significant characteristic when looking at <b class="n">The Selfish Girl</b> in historical context, 
                                    and one that has carried over to mainstream pop-culture in modern and contemporary literature and media.

                                earlier counterparts are there, however they have evolved in accordance to the setting they find themselves 
                                placed, which is a middle / high school, or even college. The introduction of films revolving around teenagers, 
                                such as teen romantic comedies (or rom-coms) or teen dramas, have made <b class="n">The Mean Girl</b> a staple, perhaps

                                ‘game’ society has placed them in, and using what they have to survive and stay at the top of the social food chain

                                simultaneously changed the way women were portrayed in media is <b class="n">Scarlett O’Hara</b> from the 1936 novel 
                                (and later the movie adaptation) <b class="n">Gone With The Wind. Scarlett</b> is a southern belle who struggles with 
                                acting as she is expected to - prettily and refined. Her determination to get what she wants paired 
                                with her intelligence dominates, and reveals selfish and narcissistic parts of her 
                                personality. She is therefore far from perfect, easily manipulating the people around her and even 
                                killing a man to achieve her goals, and is blinded / stubborn to what she thinks is right, which, 
                                coupled with her selfishness, causes her to lose her love interest, Rhett Butler.<sup>1</sup> <b class="n">Scarlett</b> 
                                as a female protagonist is thus complex and flawed, which was highly unusual at the time, and perhaps

                                dominance, became a hyper-ostentatious parody of womanhood itself — to exist as a woman was to constantly compare 
                                against and compete with other women. The Mean Girl trope had us all believe that the dark side to womanhood is catty,
