                                <p> The Artist as a sub-archetype of the Maiden is somewhat of an unusual one as she her

                                    The Maiden trope as many Artists are either used as a beautiful muse to

                                    damsel in distress situation. The Nine Muses in the Ancient Greek pantheon 
                                    are goddesses personified as creative practices, appearing before heroes to 
                                    inspire them in the form of a beautiful woman.<sup>1</sup> Scheherazade

                                    <p>The exploration of The Artist in modern media has diverged into many routes. 
                                        Although not confined to female characters, one framing of The Artist has 
                                        become much more focused on the character’s relationship with the artistic 
                                        skill that they possess. Many of these characters strive to be the absolute 
                                        best in their field, pushing for perfection even when they have seemingly 
                                        reached it to outside eyes. This ambition tends to alienate these characters 
                                        to others who unjustly think they are arrogant or are just intimidated by them. 
                                        This leads to isolation of the character, and they are further consumed by their 
                                        craft which quickly turns into an unhealthy obsession.
                                    <br></br>

                                    Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film Black Swan explores this idea of the obsessed artist 
                                    through a dark and grim lens. The protagonist, Nina Sayers is a ballet dancer, 
                                    and is cast to play the White and Black Swan in Tchaivosky’s Swan Lake.  
                                    She is not as confident in her portrayal as the Black Swan however, and the 
                                    limits she pushes herself to to portray the Black Swan perfectly leads her 
                                    into a descent of psychosis, and her eventual death. Her final performance 
                                    is deemed perfect by her rival (and lover) Lily, however she is not alive to 
                                    bask in her glory because her obsession had overcome her.<sup>1</sup>

                                    There are of course exceptions to The Artist characters that use their skills and 
                                    creativity outside of a male realm. The greek poet Sappho is famous for using 
                                    her skill to compose poems that express romantic and sexual desires toward both
                                    men and women, having agency over her own sexuality.<sup>3</sup> Although the gender of the 
                                    speaker is never explicitly stated in her lyric, Ode to Aphrodite, it is likely 
                                    that Sappho herself has these thoughts of yearning  toward the female goddess of 
                                    Love and Beauty, and Sappho is entranced by her beauty and struck by her desire 
                                    for her:
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="pullquotesblue">Very swift they came; and thou, gracious Vision,

                                <p>Further examples of The Artist that follow in similar vein to Sappho is Japan’s 
                                    Shinto Goddess of the Dawn, Mirth, Reverly and the Arts, Ame-no-Uzume no Mikoto. 
                                    She is known for her bravery, joviality and creativity, and according to Shinto 
                                    scripture, helped save the world from eternal darkness when she performed a 
                                    funny dance in order to coax her mistress, Goddess of the Sun Amaterasu, out of 
                                    the cave where she had secluded herself in shame.<sup>5</sup> Ame-no-Uzume, like Sappho, 
                                    is a maiden that uses her creative skills outside of a man’s relation to her, 
                                    instead using her skills in dance and song to save the whole whole world herself.</p>

                                        “Rabin defined the manic pixie dream girl as a muse whose primary role is 
                                        to teach and transform a young man. As contemporary a trope as it feels, 
                                        it’s as old as Dante with his vision of being guided through paradise by 
                                        his saintly Beatrice. Bettina was my guide, and as much as my adolescent 
                                        self thought it adored her, I thought less about her and more about how 
                                        it was she made me feel. Though I questioned whether I was good enough 
                                        for her, and I felt lucky that she’d chosen me, I didn’t question her 
                                        role as change agent in my life. It was a one-sided relationship not because 
                                        I was any more selfish than your average teen boy, but because I took it 
                                        for granted that this brilliant young woman knew the world better than I did.”<sup>2</sup>

                                        Another route of exploration The Artist has gone through in modern media 
                                        is the emergence into The Manic Pixie Dream Girl. The MPDG, simply put, 
                                        “is a type of female character often depicted as a whimsical, quirky, 
                                        sometimes eccentric, fantasy woman who saves the male protagonist from 
                                        himself. She usually aides in his transformation without ever showing 
                                        any real agency of her own.” <sup>3</sup> Significantly, they are also creatives 
                                        of some kind, to align with their quirky and different personalities. 
                                        The MPDG therefore aligns with a few histroic examples of The Artist, 
                                        such as The Nine Muses, as they are used as a tool in the form of a cool,
                                        beautiful woman to inspire or save the male protagonist from himself.

                                        There has also been a recent backlash to this trope however. Clementine 
                                        Kruczyinski in 2004’s Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind outwardly 
                                        fits this trope, however the movie actively rejects the notion that 
                                        she is a character that will ‘save’ the male hero, and further highlighting 
                                        the very real and harmful notions this trope projects onto young people 
                                        such as the romanticisation of mental illness.<sup>4</sup> It is interesting, 
                                        therefore, that The Artist has gone through many progressions, some still aligning 
                                        with how a few were viewed in the past, and others growing from the roots 
                                        of something more complex.</br></br>

                            <p>The Beauty is a sub-archetype of The Maiden that spans all cultures and highlights 
                                how much human beings universally value physical beauty, especially in women.<sup>1</sup> 
                                Almost all religions and folklore have deities and characters that personify this 
                                trait, and depending on the characters’ personalities and actions, reflect the many 
                                paradoxical ways in which female beauty is viewed. Examples that fit the typical 
                                maiden-like beauty can be seen in Psyche<sup>2</sup> or Andromeda,<sup>3</sup> who are beautiful but not 
                                dangerous as they are youthful, naive and submissive girls. Aphrodite<sup>4</sup> and Oshun,<sup>5</sup> 
                                the Greek and Yoruba Goddesses of Love and Beauty however represent the other side 
                                of the coin, wherein female beauty is seen as something dangerous, both deities 
                                possessing capricious, mercurial and sexually assertive natures, oftentimes fully 
                                aware of the power they hold and using their beauty and looks to achieve their own 
                                ends.

                                <br></br>

                                The Beauty is therefore seen, through the male gaze, as a woman of undeniable 
                                value due to her looks, and either something to be conquered or feared. 
                                Characters that fall under the first category tend to be one dimensional 
                                when making an appearance in folklore - the only quality mentioned is her 
                                beauty, and she is either in need of rescuing from some sort of evil and is 
                                only deemed worthy of rescuing precisely because she is beautiful. Her 
                                submissive nature and state of virginity further add to her allure, creating 
                                one speicific standard of female beauty and worth from her looks and lack of 
                                personality and sexual agency.<sup>6</sup>

                                <p>In a large part due to colonisation  and the consequent spread of eurocentric 
                                    beauty standards, The Beauty in mainstream, popular media in the west now 
                                    categorises their most beautiful women as women who were born with these traits.<sup>1</sup> 
                                    Furthermore, Hollywood as an institution has had a monopoly in the global entertainment 
                                    industry since the turn of the 20th century, and with the second world war exerting 
                                    America’s soft power through its culture, only further spread these standards 
                                    internationally.<sup>2</sup> Marilyn Monroe, for example, was a white-american woman with blond 
                                    hair and blue eyes (which, significantly, wasn’t her natural hair colour) and many 
                                    people believed was one of the most beautiful women in the world, her allure and what 
                                    she represented still having a major hold on society today.<sup>3</sup></p>

                                In comparison, examples that fall under the second category, of female beauty as seen 
                                as something to be feared, are figures that are fully aware of their value due to 
                                their looks, and utilise this to their own advantage. Aphrodite is a significant 
                                example, and she further highlights how society degradingly views women who utilise 
                                her beauty in this way, as she at times can be extremely jealous, mean spitrited 
                                and volatile.<sup>7</sup> It is important to note, therefore, that The Beauty is a sub-archetype 
                                is very paradoxical, reflecting the conflicting views many societies seem to have on 
                                female beauty and the power it holds, and how it seems to look down upon women who 
                                use the power society has given to her to achieve her goals.

                                    Old Hollywood of course acknowledged that people of other races were objectively beautiful 
                                    and cast them in films - Chinese actress Anna May Wong was extremely successful in her 
                                    career - however it is important to acknowledge that many people of color cast to play, 
                                    no matter how beautiful they were, were villains, who either attempted to seduce the 
                                    heroic and and noble white actor/actress,<sup>4</sup> or ‘exotic’ novelties who were far more 
                                    sexualised than their white counterparts who needed to be conquered by the white man 
                                    and ‘civilised.’ This mindset can still be seen in the popular Disney princess films 
                                    released from the late 90s, early 2000s, wherein characters like Esmerelda, Jasmine 
                                    and Pocahontas wore far more revealing clothes and were designed to be more curvaceous 
                                    than Belle, Aurora or Cinderella.<sup>5</sup>

                                    Of course, fighting against the Eurocentric beauty standard has become more prevalent - 
                                    African-American artists like Beyoncé have used their influence to inspire women 
                                    like her to have pride in their origins and stand against this harmful standard,<sup>6</sup> 
                                    and diversity in Hollywood has been put under a much more critical lens by the public, 
                                    which may be a positive sign for more heterogeneity in mainstream media.<sup>7</sup>

                                    complex is was a term coined by psychologist Sigmund Freud, wherein (usually) a man cannot 
                                    feel sexual arousal for his wife or someone who he respects and is in a loving relationship 
                                    in (The Madonna), however can feel sexual desire for a women who he views as degraded or 
                                    debased (The Whore).<sup>2</sup> This complex is obviously harmful, as it enforces the idea that women 
                                    who are not sexually assertive are ‘good’ and worthy of respect, whereas women who are the 
                                    opposite are ‘sluts’ and degraded sexual objects.<sup>3</sup>

                                    <p> The Madonna and The Whore as sub-archetypes has been a popular trope to explore in contemporary 
                                        literature, and many authors have taken to subvert it. In Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula, the 
                                        two women Lucy Westenra and Mina Murray juxtapose each other as Madonna and Whore, however the 
                                        two have elements of both. Lucy entertains three suitors, but is kind, pure-hearted and dies as 
                                        a virgin. Mina, while not exactly a whore, is empowered and provocative, and as she was a married 
                                        woman, it is safe to assume that she was not a virgin and played a significant role in defeating 
                                        Dracula.<sup>1</sup> Interestingly, in the movie adaptation in 1992, this subversion is erased, meaning there 
                                        may be a regression to biblical thinking in more current media.<sup>2</sup>

                                        As one can tell from the etymology, The Bible has had a large hand in the foundations of this 
                                        mindset, with The Madonna referring to the Virgin Mary, who is celebrated for becoming a mother 
                                        to Jesus without losing her virginity,  and The Whore referring, perhaps, to The Whore of Babylon, 
                                        who ‘tempted’ the Kings of Earth to commit adultery and bringing forth the end of the world 
                                        (it is significant to note here that the blame lies entirely on the woman, and views men as 
                                        helpless victims to their desires and not as an active participant).<sup>4</sup> Both are weighed on the 
                                        scale of morality due to their sexual status, and that is all that they are defined by.

                                        Cultures and religions from a time before the rise of Christianity likewise had their own views that 
                                        reflected The Madonna-Whore Complex, and the patriarchal dictatorship and double standard when it 
                                        comes to the state of a woman’s sexuality has been a popular of point of discussion since what seems 
                                        to be almost the beginning of time. However, some cultures had slightly more complex and nuanced

                                        interest of the popular bad boy, Steve Harrington. In the third episode, Nancy loses her virginity 
                                        to Steve, however while she and Steve sleep together, Nancy’s best friend Barb is killed by the 
                                        Demogorgon.<sup>3</sup> From Nancy losing her virginity in a room that is just upstairs from where Barb was 
                                        sitting moments before her death, an interpretation could be made that this is Nancy’s punishment 
                                        for losing her virginity and for her transition from Madonna to Whore.<sup>4</sup> Of course, the opposite 
                                        could be assumed as this subverts the stereotypical horror trope that the promiscuous girl dies 
                                        and the virgin lives.<sup>5</sup> However, it is still a visual  representation on how one girl deserves to 
                                        live over the other due to their sexual status.

                                        Martin Scorsese’s 1976 film Taxi Driver further delves into this regression, however the regression is 
                                        from the view point of Travis, the male protagonist, and the film in fact criticises the narrow minded 
                                        and delusional way he views women (as well as the rest of the world). Travis was infatuated with Betty 
                                        and saw her as a beacon of purity, however after she rejects him, he instantly changes and sees her as 
                                        “just like all the others” (whore). On the other hand, he starts off seeing Iris, a prostitute, as a 
                                        whore, however he soon becomes obsessed with becoming her white night and ‘saving’ her, largely due to 
                                        how young she is - when he dies, she appears as a fgure in white, as if she was an angel.<sup>6</sup>

                                            This moment was captured well in an episode of Sex and the City between Charlotte (played by 
                                            Kristin Davis) and Trey (played by Kyle MacLachlan). Followng their wedding, Trey is unable to 
                                            perform as he sees Charlotte as the virginal character who he wed. To switch this perception, 
                                            Charlotte plays with herself in front of him to show she is, in fact, a woman with desires.” <sup>7</sup>

                                        A popular Mayan legend about The Xtabay (The Jungle Witch)  tells a story about two sisters, Xkeban 
                                        and Utz-colel. They were both beautiful, however Xkeban was far more promiscuous than the Utz-colel, 
                                        who was a virgin. One was treated badly by her community because of this and the other celebrated, 
                                        however what is different about this tale is that The Whore was kind and giving to her community 
                                        and far from evil, whereas the The Madonna was cruel, cold-hearted and thought she was superior to 
                                        everyone. When Xkeban died, she metamorphosed into a beautiful and fragrant smelling flower, and 
                                        Utz-Colel arrogantly and jealously thought she would morph into an even prettier flower. However 
                                        when her time came her dead body had an unbearable smell, and flowers disappeared around it. 
                                        Utz-colel eventually became The Xtabay, a demon, as she was so consumed in her jealousy and rage 
                                        even after death.<sup>5</sup> It is significant to see a very different moral on the Madonna-Whore archetype 
                                        from such an ancient culture, however this highlights how  rooted The Madonna-Whore complex is in 
                                        inaccurate, sexist and toxic prejudices.

                                <p>Once of the first instances of The Stepmother in literature can be seen in the Bible, when Sarah, 
                                    who birthed Abraham’s son, cast out his other children to die so as to not “dilute the inheritance 
                                    pool.”<sup>1</sup> The most well-known examples of this sub-archetypes however are perhaps the characters 
                                    from the The Brothers Grimm’s stories, such as The Evil Queen in Snow White and The Wicked Stepmother 
                                    from Cinderella.<sup>2</sup> It is crucial to note that The Stepmother as a sub-archetype is known as a villainous 
                                    one, acting as a cruel antagonist for the protagonist (who is most likely are pure and sweet maiden),

                                    <p>Despite the passage of time, the connotation of evil tied to The Stepmother is still very 
                                        prevalent. The most well known characters from modern and more contemporary times are 
                                        perhaps the Lady Tremaine<sup>1</sup> and The Evil Queen<sup>2</sup> from Disney’s animated adaptations of 
                                        Cinderella and Snow White. These two fairytales are still beloved in the present day, 
                                        with many adaptations released with different twists to the classic stories 
                                        (Mirror Mirror,<sup>3</sup> the 2012 adaptation of Snow White, is an example of this) 
                                        However the evil stepmother trope is a key component that remains in each retelling, 
                                        meaning this stereotype has lived on to the present day. A classic film outside of 
                                        folktale adaptation that utilises this archetype is 1998’s The Parent Trap,<sup>4</sup> wherein 
                                        the gold-digging stepmother, attempts to thwart the protagonist’s plan to get their

                                    The Stepmothers in both Cinderella and Snow White do reflect some truth of the society they were 
                                    created in. During the 18th / 19th century, it was extremely common for women to die in childbirth,
                                    and the mortality rate was already very low, and  many children were left solely in the care of 
                                    their father - unless he remarried. This sub-archetype acts as a cautionary tale for both the 
                                    father and the step-mother - to do right by the children, or else something horrible may happen 
                                    to you.<sup>4</sup> Interestingly, studies have shown that “stepparents do harm children at higher rates 
                                    per capita than genetic parents.” however all instances of violence are committed by the 
                                    stepfather, not the stepmother.<sup>5</sup> The stories therefore do not reflect reality and it is important 
                                    to ask the questions of why have the stepmothers been villanised, and why is the abuse in these 
                                    stories almost always targeted toward the stepdaughter, and never the sons.

                                    The fear of The Stepmother can also be seen in folklore outside of the west. 
                                    Janghwa Hongryeon Jeon (or A Tale of Two Sisters) is a folktale from South Korea that depicts 
                                    a cruel stepmother’s abuse that results in the death of two daughters - Janghwa and Hongryeon 
                                    - however the stepmother and her sons are sentenced to death for their misdeed against the 
                                    girls and are put to death<sup>6</sup> (significantly, the father although also complicit in the abuse,  
                                    is judged as innocent as he wasn’t aware of his wife’s crimes).

                                        As with most sub-archetypes however, there has been a backlash seen in modern media against the 
                                        evil stepmother trope. The 1998 movie Stepmom, starring Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon sees 
                                        the stepmother, Isabel, attempting to do her best to connect with her new husband’s family
                                        who are fiercely loyal to their mother, Jackie.<sup>5</sup> The Stepmother is the protagonist and the 
                                        sympathetic figure in the narrative, while the original mother is the antagonist, however the 
                                        film gives nuanced reasons as to why the two women act this way, and ends not with one woman 
                                        ‘winning’ over the other, but them coming to a mutual understanding and even becoming friends 
                                        to make the transition easier for the rest of the family, as well as themselves. Although 
                                        dramatised, this dynamic may be a far more accurate representation of modern families today, 
                                        and how step-families cope with changing family dynamics.
                                        <br></br>
                                        Brenda MacGuff from 2007’s Juno is another character that turns the evil stepmother trope on 
                                        its head, as she is and incredibly supportive stepmother to her step-daughter and protagonist, 
                                        Juno.<sup>6</sup> Like Isabel, she reflects a more nuaunced reality of stepmothers and modern family 
                                        dynamics, and challenges the evil stepmother trope.
